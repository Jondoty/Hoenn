#Dialogue 1 - After spawn lobby
#Professor Birch's Opening Speech
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=130

<...> Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
<...> Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
<...> My name is Birch.

#Player sets down their PokeNav

<Professor Birch> But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor.
<Professor Birch> And this...is what we call a “Pokémon.”
<Professor Birch> This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times playing together as friends, and at times helping one another out.
<Professor Birch> And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling others like us!
<Professor Birch> But as close as we are, we don't know everything about Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> In fact, there are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon mysteries. But that's enough about me!
<Professor Birch> What about you?
<Professor Birch> Will you give me your name?
<Professor Birch> So you're @s?
<Professor Birch> Ah... I see!
<Professor Birch> You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
<Professor Birch> Are you ready?
<Professor Birch> Your very own adventure is now about to unfold!
<Professor Birch> Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon where dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
<Professor Birch> I expect we'll be meeting again soon. Come see me in my Pokémon Lab!

<Mom> @s! You're here at last!
<Mom> Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way?
<Mom> Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think?
<Mom> This is going to be our new home!
<Mom> It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think?
<Mom> And you get your own room this time, @s! Come on. You have to see the inside!

#teleports player inside

#tps mom out

<Mom> See, @s? Isn't it nice in here, too?
<Mom> The moving company's Pokémon even help with the unpacking and cleanup. They really make moving a cinch!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...

#Spawn exclamation above Mom

<Mom> Thanks for all the hard work! We really appreciate it!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...
<Machoke> Gwagwah gwah...

#Machoke leave

<Mom> You should go and see your new room upstairs, @s!
<Mom> Dad even bought a new clock for it to help celebrate the big move.

Interviewer: ...

Interviewer: We brought you this report live from in front of Petalburg Gym.
Next up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower in the next star show...

<Mom> Oh... It's already ended.
<Mom> Looks like your dad was on, but we missed his part. What a shame.

<Mom> But that reminds me... One of Dad's friends lives in this town.
<Mom> Professor Birch is his name.
<Mom> He lives right next door, so you should go over and introduce yourself.

<Mrs. Birch> Welcome!

<Mrs. Birch> We have a daughter about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> She has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> She should be in her room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> We have a son who is just about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> He has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> He should be in his room upstairs.

<...> Huh?!
<...> Who...are you?
<...> ...
<...> Oh! You must be @s! Your move was today, huh?
<May> Well, I'm May! Glad to meet you!
<May> I...I actually have this dream of becoming friends with Pokémon all over the world.
<May> And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch— told me about you moving here, @s...
<May> Well, I was hoping you would be nice and we could be friends.
<May> ...B-but that's just silly, isn't it?
<May> I've just met you. Right, @s? So what am I talking about...
<May> Hee hee...
<May> Oh no! I forgot! I was supposed to be going out to help Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
<May> @s, I'll see you later!

#May runs off

#Meeting your rival (Brendan)

<...> Pokémon fully restored... Items all packed, and...
<...> Y-you... Who are you?
<...> @s? Oh, you're the new kid who just moved in next door?!
<...> ad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me you were the kid of a Gym Leader, and I sort of hoped you'd be a guy.
<Brendan> My name's Brendan. Well, I guess we are still neighbors, so...
<Brendan> Nice to meet you! Let's be friends, OK?
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s... Don't you have any Pokémon?
<Brendan> If you want, I can go catch you one.
<Brendan> Aw, wait, I forgot... I'm supposed to be going out to help my dad catch some wild Pokémon.
<Brendan> Some other time, OK?

<Professor Birch> Whew...
<Professor Birch> I went into the tall grass to survey wild Pokémon when I was suddenly jumped!
<Professor Birch> You saved my hide. Thanks a lot!
<Professor Birch> Oh? But you're Norman's kid, @s!
<Professor Birch> I didn't even realize who you were at first.
<Professor Birch> You've grown into quite the young kid.
<Professor Birch> This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.

#Teleports player to lab
<Professor Birch> So, @s! I've heard so much about you from your father.
<Professor Birch> But he said that you don't have your own Pokémon yet.
<Professor Birch> If that's true, that was quite the performance back there!
<Professor Birch> Looks like you really are your father's kid!
<Professor Birch> Oh, yes! To say thanks for rescuing me out there, how about I give you that Pokémon you used earlier?

@s received Treecko!
@s received Torchic!
@s received Mudkip!

<Professor Birch> You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain experience, I think you'll make a pretty excellent Trainer.

<Professor Birch> My girl, May, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.
<Professor Birch> My boy, Brendan, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.

<Professor Birch> It might not be a bad idea for you to head out that way yourself.
<Professor Birch> What do you think?

<Professor Birch> She can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure Brendan'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> He can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Oh, yes!
<Professor Birch> And if you're ever lost along the way, use the AreaNav on your PokéNav Plus!
<Professor Birch> You can use it to see how to get to Route 103, where May ought to be.
<Professor Birch> And if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest back at your new house.

<Shopkeeper> Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart.
<Shopkeeper> From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right?
<Shopkeeper> OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
<Shopkeeper> First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof.
<Shopkeeper> We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
<Shopkeeper> I'd like you to have these as part of a special promotion!

@s obtained Potions!

<Shopkeeper> Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.

#Teleports player and npc to Pokemon Center

<Shopkeeper> And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof!
<Shopkeeper> Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health.
<Shopkeeper> That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk.
<Shopkeeper> Have a great journey!

<May> and this one...and this one, too...
<May> Oh! Hey, @s!
<May> What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
<May> Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle?
<May> I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!

<Brendan> OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s!
<Brendan> Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad?
<Brendan> Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
<Brendan> I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!

#pokeheal
Your team's health was restored!

<May> Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now.
<May> I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
<May> I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
<May> Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!


<Brendan> I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
<Brendan> Look, you just got your Pokémon, right?
<Brendan> And you already have that strong of a bond?
<Brendan> I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, @s. No doubt.
<Brendan> Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab.
<Brendan> You should head back, too, @s!

#After battling rival for the first time
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1472

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat May on your first try.
<Professor Birch> That's amazing! May's been helping with my research for a long time, so she has a pretty long history as a Trainer already.
<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat Brendan on your first try.

<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

@s received a Pokédex!

<Professor Birch> That Pokédex is a high-tech tool that automatically makes a record of any Pokémon you meet or catch.

<Professor Birch> My girl May takes hers with her everywhere she goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever she catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, she comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> My boy Brendan takes his with him everywhere he goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever he catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, he comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> The Pokémon and people you will meet...
<Professor Birch> And the great expanse of nature that lies before you!
<Professor Birch> Experience them both while you fill in your Pokédex. I'd love it if your world seemed wider than ever!
<Professor Birch> Though I'd love it even more if you came back from time to time to show me what progress you've made.
<Professor Birch> ...Arghhh! I'm getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!


<May> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<May> That's great. Just like me!
<May> Then here... I'll give you something, too!
<May> Some Poké Balls that you can use to catch wild Pokémon!

@s obtained Poké Balls!

<May> If you catch a Pokémon in the wild and battle together with it for a while, it will grow stronger for you!
<May> Take that as a bit of advice from a more experienced Trainer like me!
<May> I'm going to get ready to head out from Littleroot soon myself.
<May> I can't wait to see what kind of Pokémon I'm going to meet...


<Brendan> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<Brendan> That's great. Just like me!

Your PokéNav Plus has been updated! The DexNav function has been added to your PokéNav Plus!

<May> The app I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called the DexNav.
<May> It can tell you lots about the Pokémon living in each area and that kind of stuff.
<May> It's a handy app to have if you're trying to catch lots of different Pokémon.
<May> Guess it's about time I use the DexNav to do a little more catching myself!
<May> I'm gonna head that way and see what I find.
<May> @s, you should use those Poké Balls I gave you earlier to do a bit of catching, too!

<Wally> Y-yes... I'm supposed to go stay with my relatives in Verdanturf Town for a while.
<Wally> But I thought I might be lonely by myself, so I wanted to bring a Pokémon with me.
<Wally> But I've never caught a Pokémon by myself...
<Wally> I'm not sure if I can.

<Dad> Mm-hmm. I see.
<Dad> @s! You heard all that, right?
<Dad> You go with Wally, and make sure that he safely catches a Pokémon.
<Dad> Wally, here. I'll lend you one of my Pokémon.

#Wally teleports out

<Dad> Hmm. That boy will be worth keeping an eye on. But for now...
<Dad> @s!
<Dad> If you want to become strong as a Trainer, listen to my advice.
<Dad> First head for Rustboro City, which lies beyond this town.
<Dad> There you should challenge the Gym Leader, Roxanne.
<Dad> After her, go on to the other Pokémon Gyms and defeat their Leaders as well.
<Dad> Collect Badges from them, understand?
<Dad> Of course, I'm a Gym Leader, too. I'm sure we'll battle one day.
<Dad> But that will only be after you've become stronger, @s.

<Cutter> That determined expression...

<Cutter> And your well-trained Pokémon...
<Cutter> You're obviously a skilled Trainer!
<Cutter> No, wait, don't say a word. I can tell just by looking at you.
<Cutter> I'm sure that you will be capable of putting this HM to good use.
<Cutter> No need to be modest or shy. Go on, take it!

@s obtained HM01 Cut!

<Cutter> That's an axe that can chop down prickly trees if the Trainer has earned the Stone Badge.
<Cutter> HMs like this can be used outside of battle, too, with the right Badges!

<Roxanne> I am Roxanne, the Rustboro City Pokémon Gym Leader.
<Roxanne> I became a Gym Leader so that I may apply in battle all that I've learned at the Pokémon Trainers' School.
<Roxanne> If you defeat me in a Pokémon battle, I'll present you with a Gym Badge as proof of your strength as a Trainer.
<Roxanne> Please take up the challenge.
<Roxanne> I look forward to seeing you as a challenger. Until then, farewell.

<Gym Guy> Listen, my friend! Would you like to become the Champion?
<Gym Guy> I'm no Trainer, not me, but I can sure give you winning advice.
<Gym Guy> That's settled, then! We'll aim for the Pokémon Championship together!
<Gym Guy> It's your job as a Trainer to collect Gym Badges, am I right?
<Gym Guy> But Gym Leaders aren't pushovers! And that's where I come in!
<Gym Guy> I'm here to provide expert advice!
<Gym Guy> Roxanne, the Gym Leader here, is a user of Rock-type Pokémon.
<Gym Guy> The Rock type is very durable, but it can't stand Water-type and Grass-type moves.
<Gym Guy> Well, go for it!

#Dialogue 25 - Rustboro Gym
#Roxanne post-battle

<Roxanne> I understand.
<Roxanne> The Pokémon League's rules state that Trainers receive this if they defeat a Gym Leader.
<Roxanne> Please accept the official Pokémon League Stone Badge.
@s received the Stone Badge from Roxanne.
<Roxanne> The Stone Badge enables Pokémon to use the HM move Cut outside of battle.
<Roxanne> And... Please take this with you, too.

@s obtained TM37 Rock Tomb!

<Roxanne> The move Rock Tomb not only inflicts damage by dropping rocks, it also lowers the target's Speed.
<Roxanne> If you use a TM, it instantly teaches the move to a Pokémon.
<Roxanne> You can use a TM as many times as you want, so please try it out!

<Mr. Stone> There's a favor I'd like to ask of a reliable Trainer like you.

<Mr. Stone> I'd never be so mean as to ask a favor for nothing in return.
<Mr. Stone> Here, give me your PokéNav Plus for a moment.

Mr. Stone updated your PokéNav Plus! You can now use the BuzzNav function on your PokéNav Plus!

<Mr. Stone> The function that I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called BuzzNav.
<Mr. Stone> It is an indispensable tool for any Trainer who is traveling out in the world.
<Mr. Stone> Use it, and you'll be able to get the latest news from around the region and from your own friends, anytime and anyplace.

<Brawly> I'm sure this will help your Pokémon bulk up muscle!

@s obtained TM08 Bulk Up!

<Brawly> Bulk Up temporarily enhances the Pokémon's muscle power.
<Brawly> The move boosts both Attack and Defense stats of the Pokémon.
<Brawly> I can see your talent becoming a giant wave that causes a storm of astonishment with Trainers one day!
<Brawly> I look forward to the day when I can surf your giant wave!
<Brawly> By the way, have you been to Granite Cave? It's located to the north of this town.

But this appearance here... It seems somehow different from Mega Evolution... Hmm.
It seems my questions will not be answered today.
Hm?
You are...?
...
Ah, I see. It's a pleasure, @s.
My apologies. My name is Steven.
I'm interested in rare stones, so I travel here and there.
Today my journey brought me here, but what about you?
Oh? A letter for me?
@s gave Steven the letter they had been entrusted with!
Why, thank you...
It must have been some trouble to track me down. I suppose I must repay you in some way.
Let me see...
I will give you this TM. Please accept it. It contains my favorite move, Steel Wing.

@s obtained TM51 STeel Wing!

#View of overhead, Steven looking at the wall

If you don't mind me asking... Do you feel anything in particular when you look up at this wall?
A primal world, lost thousands of years in the past...
A Legendary Pokémon of tremendous power became humanity's greatest threat...
The terror aroused by that power is clear to see in this ancient artwork.


...Yes. But not all power is terrible. Your Pokémon are clearly quite capable as well.
Looking at you all together... I think that you have in you what it takes to become a Pokémon League Champion.
As long as you keep training, that is.
Good luck to you. I must be going now.

<Fan Club Chairman> No one! In any contest, my victory is a foregone conclusion!
<Fan Club Chairman> But that would deprive others of their enjoyment.
<Fan Club Chairman> So I now while away my time examining the Pokémon of others.
<Fan Club Chairman> It is marvelous to witness how others have raised Pokémon.
<Fan Club Chairman> The contented faces of properly raised Pokémon...
<Fan Club Chairman> The kind and loving gazes of their Trainers...
<Fan Club Chairman> My heart is overwhelmed—there is so much happiness.
<Fan Club Chairman> Oh my! Excuse me! I seem to have nattered on far too long!
<Fan Club Chairman> Please, do allow me to examine your Pokémon and see how it's grown.

How is your Pokémon growing? Allow me to examine it.
Hmmhm... I see...

#Mehs
Hmmm... It's not bad, but it's not good, either.
You, the Trainer, must put more effort into raising this Pokémon!
For instance, may I suggest that you give it more Pokéblocks?

#if the player's lead Pokémon has at least 200 stats. Is this possible to track?? Could perhaps track if the trainer has earned 200+ points in each category

Your @e, it is growing in a most impressive manner!
It is one fine specimen! But!
If you let it hold this item, it would become even more attractive! Indeed!

Let a Pokémon hold that Red Scarf. Everyone will recognize the coolness of that Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Blue Scarf. Its beauty will be accentuated much more than now!
Let a Pokémon hold that Pink Scarf. It will draw out the cuteness of the Pokémon some more!
Let a Pokémon hold that Green Scarf. That will enhance the cleverness of the Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Yellow Scarf. It will bolster your Pokémon's toughness!

I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to give you! None at all!
After all, you're blessed with the gift of raising Pokémon without resorting to any items!

<...> What do we have here?
<...> I came to see what was taking so long just to steal a few parts, and I find you simps getting beat by this kid?
<...> Heh! That's quite a fierce expression for such a wee little scamp.
<...> That face tells me you're not just another mindless Trainer brat.
<Archie> The name is Archie.
<Archie> The rough-looking lot you see here are members of my team—Team Aqua.
<Archie> So tell me, child...
<Archie> Do you know that Pokémon, people, and all life in this world depend on the sea for life?
<Archie> That's right. The sea is an irreplaceable treasure for every living thing on this planet.
<Archie> But with our selfish extravagance, humanity dirties the great ocean, destroying this source of all life...
<Archie> Day by day, we're all destroying our most precious resource!
<Archie> If we humans suffer from our actions, well, maybe we'll end up getting what we deserve.
<Archie> But what about the Pokémon in our world?
<Archie> The Pokémon that no longer have a place to live because we stole and soiled their seas?
<Archie> The Pokémon that won't have a place to raise their young and watch them grow?
<Archie> We are creating a world in which innocent Pokémon suffer as a result of our actions...
<Archie> And that is something that I can't forgive!
<Archie> That's why I came to a decision, see?
<Archie> The foolish actions of my fellow humans, the seas we have blighted, nature itself...
<Archie> I will return everything to its unspoiled beginnings!
<Archie> ... Heh! It's not like me to talk so much.
<Archie> Never mind, little scamp...
<Archie> I'll withdraw for now and leave you be.
<Archie> But understand this...
<Archie> Get in my way again, and you won't walk away unscathed next time.
<Archie> Remember that, at least!
<Archie> We're moving out, lads!










#Maxie
<...> Now here I was wondering how you could be held up in the simple act of seizing a case.
<...> Do I take it you are being stymied by this child?
<...> Hmm. Though you are but a child, your eyes tell me of your fierce determination.
<...> My heart is pounding in my chest...
<...> Yes, I think I can see why my lowly Grunts could not stand one minute against you.
<Maxie> I am called Maxie.
<Maxie> I stand as the head of Team Magma, a noble organization whose goal is to propel humanity to even greater heights of progress and evolution.
<Maxie> Indeed.
<Maxie> And you are one of the young persons who may shape our society's future.
<Maxie> Considering that fact, I believe I shall educate you in the ways of the world.
<Maxie> The land...
<Maxie> It is the stage upon which humanity stands.
<Maxie> The land exists so we humans might continue onward and upward, stepping into the future...
<Maxie> For us to continue growing and evolving, humans require a grand stage upon which to stand.
<Maxie> A land upon which we can stride forward...
<Maxie> A land we can explore...develop...exploit...
<Maxie> This is the basis for the growth of all human endeavor.
<Maxie> That is why we, Team Magma, must increase the landmass of this world!
<Maxie> Believe that this will lead to a future of eternal happiness for humanity...
<Maxie> And consequently for all life!
<Maxie> Humph. I suppose the concept may still be too difficult for a child to comprehend.
<Maxie> Is that the case?
<Maxie> At least I have tried to open your mind.
<Maxie> I will take my leave for now.
<Maxie> I suggest you take care that you never again stand against Team Magma.
<Maxie> I will not be so lenient the next time.
<Maxie> I implore you to remember that.
<Maxie> We are done here.

<Contest Clerk> During the contest, your Pokémon will show the audience just how lovely it is!
<Contest Clerk> First up is the Introduction Round!
<Contest Clerk> The appearance of Pokémon that have raised their Coolness, Cuteness, or other conditions will be judged.
<Contest Clerk> After the Introduction Round, it's time for the Talent Round!
<Contest Clerk> It's a competition to determine how well Pokémon can use their moves over the course of five turns.
<Contest Clerk> Use moves that match the condition of the contest to make the audience go crazy!
<Contest Clerk> If you check the moves of the Pokémon that you want to put in the contest, you can see that they're split into five different conditions, such as Coolness and Cuteness.
<Contest Clerk> If you're in a contest with the same title as that condition, you can use that move to appeal to the crowd!
<Contest Clerk> After you place first in a Normal Rank contest, you can win your way through higher ranks!
<Contest Clerk> Very well...
<Contest Clerk> Right this way, please!

<Lisia> @s's story begins today!
