#Thinking for these split Brendan/May dialogues if one is significantly longer than the other, the shorter one can add time at the end to complete the dialogue, so they're consistent between players

#Dialogue 1 - After spawn lobby
#Professor Birch's Opening Speech
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=130

<...> Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
<...> Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
<...> My name is Birch.

#Player sets down their PokeNav

<Professor Birch> But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor.
<Professor Birch> And this...is what we call a “Pokémon.”
<Professor Birch> This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times playing together as friends, and at times helping one another out.
<Professor Birch> And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling others like us!
<Professor Birch> But as close as we are, we don't know everything about Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> In fact, there are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon mysteries. But that's enough about me!
<Professor Birch> What about you?
<Professor Birch> Will you give me your name?
<Professor Birch> So you're @s?
<Professor Birch> Ah... I see!
<Professor Birch> You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
<Professor Birch> Are you ready?
<Professor Birch> Your very own adventure is now about to unfold!
<Professor Birch> Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon where dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
<Professor Birch> I expect we'll be meeting again soon. Come see me in my Pokémon Lab!

#Dialogue 2 - Littleroot Town
#Mom outside of house
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=292

<Mom> @s! You're here at last!
<Mom> Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way?
<Mom> Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think?
<Mom> This is going to be our new home!
<Mom> It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think?
<Mom> And you get your own room this time, @s! Come on. You have to see the inside!

#teleports player inside

#tps mom out

<Mom> See, @s? Isn't it nice in here, too?
<Mom> The moving company's Pokémon even help with the unpacking and cleanup. They really make moving a cinch!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...

#Spawn exclamation above Mom

<Mom> Thanks for all the hard work! We really appreciate it!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...
<Machoke> Gwagwah gwah...

#Machoke leave

<Mom> You should go and see your new room upstairs, @s!
<Mom> Dad even bought a new clock for it to help celebrate the big move.

#Dialogue 3 - Littleroot Town
#After player has visited their room upstairs
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=438

<Mom> Oh! @s! @s!!!
<Mom> Quick! Come quickly!
<Mom> It's the Petalburg Gym! Maybe Dad will be on TV!

Interviewer: ...

Interviewer: We brought you this report live from in front of Petalburg Gym.
Next up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower in the next star show...

<Mom> Oh... It's already ended.
<Mom> Looks like your dad was on, but we missed his part. What a shame.

<Mom> But that reminds me... One of Dad's friends lives in this town.
<Mom> Professor Birch is his name.
<Mom> He lives right next door, so you should go over and introduce yourself.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Dialogue 4 - Littleroot Town
#Player entering their rival's house
https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=491

<..> Oh, hello. And you are?
<Mrs. Birch> ... Oh, you're @s, our new next-door neighbor!
<Mrs. Birch> Welcome!

<Mrs. Birch> We have a daughter about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> She has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> She should be in her room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> We have a son who is just about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> He has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> He should be in his room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> I hope you'll go and introduce yourself!

#Dialogue 5 - Littleroot Town
#Meeting your rival (May)
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=515

<...> Pokémon fully restored, items all ready, and...

#Spawn Exclamation

<...> Huh?!
<...> Who...are you?
<...> ...
<...> Oh! You must be @s! Your move was today, huh?
<May> Well, I'm May! Glad to meet you!
<May> I...I actually have this dream of becoming friends with Pokémon all over the world.
<May> And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch— told me about you moving here, @s...
<May> Well, I was hoping you would be nice and we could be friends.
<May> ...B-but that's just silly, isn't it?
<May> I've just met you. Right, @s? So what am I talking about...
<May> Hee hee...
<May> Oh no! I forgot! I was supposed to be going out to help Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
<May> @s, I'll see you later!

#May runs off

#-----------------------------
#Meeting your rival (Brendan)

<...> Pokémon fully restored... Items all packed, and...
<...> Y-you... Who are you?
<...> @s? Oh, you're the new kid who just moved in next door?!
<...> ad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me you were the kid of a Gym Leader, and I sort of hoped you'd be a guy.
<Brendan> My name's Brendan. Well, I guess we are still neighbors, so...
<Brendan> Nice to meet you! Let's be friends, OK?
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s... Don't you have any Pokémon?
<Brendan> If you want, I can go catch you one.
<Brendan> Aw, wait, I forgot... I'm supposed to be going out to help my dad catch some wild Pokémon.
<Brendan> Some other time, OK?

#Brendan runs off

#Dialogue 6 - Route 101
#Professor Birch pre-picking starters
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=683

<Youngster> I think I hear someone screaming up ahead!
<Youngster> What should I do? What should we do?
<Youngster> Somebody has to go help...

H-help me!

<Professor Birch> Halloo! You over there!
<Professor Birch> Please! Help me out!
<Professor Birch> In my Bag! There are some Poké Balls!

#Dialogue 7 - Route 101
#After battling Poochyena
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=796

<Professor Birch> Whew...
<Professor Birch> I went into the tall grass to survey wild Pokémon when I was suddenly jumped!
<Professor Birch> You saved my hide. Thanks a lot!
<Professor Birch> Oh? But you're Norman's kid, @s!
<Professor Birch> I didn't even realize who you were at first.
<Professor Birch> You've grown into quite the young kid.
<Professor Birch> This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.

#Teleports player to lab
<Professor Birch> So, @s! I've heard so much about you from your father.
<Professor Birch> But he said that you don't have your own Pokémon yet.
<Professor Birch> If that's true, that was quite the performance back there!
<Professor Birch> Looks like you really are your father's kid!
<Professor Birch> Oh, yes! To say thanks for rescuing me out there, how about I give you that Pokémon you used earlier?

@s received Treecko!
@s received Torchic!
@s received Mudkip!

<Professor Birch> You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain experience, I think you'll make a pretty excellent Trainer.

<Professor Birch> My girl, May, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.
<Professor Birch> My boy, Brendan, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.

<Professor Birch> It might not be a bad idea for you to head out that way yourself.
<Professor Birch> What do you think?
[Yes]     [No]

No dialogue:
Oh, don't be that way! You should go meet my kid.

#Dialogue 8 - Birch's Lab

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure May'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> She can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure Brendan'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> He can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Oh, yes!
<Professor Birch> And if you're ever lost along the way, use the AreaNav on your PokéNav Plus!
<Professor Birch> You can use it to see how to get to Route 103, where May ought to be.
<Professor Birch> And if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest back at your new house.

#Dialogue 9 - Oldale Town
#Shopkeeper showing the Mart
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1019

<Shopkeeper> Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart.
<Shopkeeper> From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right?
<Shopkeeper> OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
<Shopkeeper> First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof.
<Shopkeeper> We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
<Shopkeeper> I'd like you to have these as part of a special promotion!

@s obtained Potions!

<Shopkeeper> Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.

#Teleports player and npc to Pokemon Center

<Shopkeeper> And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof!
<Shopkeeper> Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health.
<Shopkeeper> That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk.
<Shopkeeper> Have a great journey!

#First battle with Rival
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1284

<May> Let's see... On Route 103, I found this Pokémon...
<May> and this one...and this one, too...
<May> Oh! Hey, @s!
<May> What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
<May> Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle?
<May> I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!

<Brendan> OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s!
<Brendan> Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad?
<Brendan> Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
<Brendan> I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!

#Post-battle with Rival


<May> It was a good battle. Thanks! Let me heal up both our parties real quick.
<Brendan> It was a good battle. Thanks! Here! Lemme heal up both our parties real quick.

#pokeheal
Your team's health was restored!

<May> Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now.
<May> I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
<May> I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
<May> Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!


<Brendan> I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
<Brendan> Look, you just got your Pokémon, right?
<Brendan> And you already have that strong of a bond?
<Brendan> I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, @s. No doubt.
<Brendan> Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab.
<Brendan> You should head back, too, @s!

#Dialogue 12 - Birch's Lab
#After battling rival for the first time
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1472

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat May on your first try.
<Professor Birch> That's amazing! May's been helping with my research for a long time, so she has a pretty long history as a Trainer already.
<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat Brendan on your first try.
<Professor Birch> Amazing! Brendan's been helping with my research for a long time, so he has a pretty long history as a Trainer already.
<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

@s received a Pokédex!

<Professor Birch> That Pokédex is a high-tech tool that automatically makes a record of any Pokémon you meet or catch.

<Professor Birch> My girl May takes hers with her everywhere she goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever she catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, she comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> My boy Brendan takes his with him everywhere he goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever he catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, he comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> The Pokémon and people you will meet...
<Professor Birch> And the great expanse of nature that lies before you!
<Professor Birch> Experience them both while you fill in your Pokédex. I'd love it if your world seemed wider than ever!
<Professor Birch> Though I'd love it even more if you came back from time to time to show me what progress you've made.
<Professor Birch> ...Arghhh! I'm getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!


<May> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<May> That's great. Just like me!
<May> Then here... I'll give you something, too!
<May> Some Poké Balls that you can use to catch wild Pokémon!

@s obtained Poké Balls!

<May> If you catch a Pokémon in the wild and battle together with it for a while, it will grow stronger for you!
<May> Take that as a bit of advice from a more experienced Trainer like me!
<May> I'm going to get ready to head out from Littleroot soon myself.
<May> I can't wait to see what kind of Pokémon I'm going to meet...


<Brendan> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<Brendan> That's great. Just like me!
<Brendan> Then here... I'll give you something, too!

<Mom> You look good together with a Pokémon!
<Mom> ...

<May> This is from my dad. He said he forgot to give it to you before.

Your PokéNav Plus has been updated! The DexNav function has been added to your PokéNav Plus!

<May> The app I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called the DexNav.
<May> It can tell you lots about the Pokémon living in each area and that kind of stuff.
<May> It's a handy app to have if you're trying to catch lots of different Pokémon.
<May> Guess it's about time I use the DexNav to do a little more catching myself!
<May> I'm gonna head that way and see what I find.
<May> @s, you should use those Poké Balls I gave you earlier to do a bit of catching, too!

<May> How's it going, @s?
<May> Have you been using your DexNav and perfecting your sneaking skills?
<May> I hope you already checked out the DexNav's Detector Mode.
<May> It reacts to Pokémon in the area, so it's really handy!
<May> Ah!
<May> Look! Up there! Check 'em out, @s!
<May> Those were...Beautifly, weren't they?
<May> I'll have to check in my DexNav later to be sure!
