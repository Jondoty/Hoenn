#Dialogue 1 - After spawn lobby
#Professor Birch's Opening Speech
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=130

<...> Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
<...> Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
<...> My name is Birch.

#Player sets down their PokeNav

<Professor Birch> But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor.
<Professor Birch> And this...is what we call a “Pokémon.”
<Professor Birch> This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times playing together as friends, and at times helping one another out.
<Professor Birch> And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling others like us!
<Professor Birch> But as close as we are, we don't know everything about Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> In fact, there are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon mysteries. But that's enough about me!
<Professor Birch> What about you?
<Professor Birch> Will you give me your name?
<Professor Birch> So you're @s?
<Professor Birch> Ah... I see!
<Professor Birch> You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
<Professor Birch> Are you ready?
<Professor Birch> Your very own adventure is now about to unfold!
<Professor Birch> Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon where dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
<Professor Birch> I expect we'll be meeting again soon. Come see me in my Pokémon Lab!

<Mom> @s! You're here at last!
<Mom> Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way?
<Mom> Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think?
<Mom> This is going to be our new home!
<Mom> It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think?
<Mom> And you get your own room this time, @s! Come on. You have to see the inside!

#teleports player inside

#tps mom out

<Mom> See, @s? Isn't it nice in here, too?
<Mom> The moving company's Pokémon even help with the unpacking and cleanup. They really make moving a cinch!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...

#Spawn exclamation above Mom

<Mom> Thanks for all the hard work! We really appreciate it!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...
<Machoke> Gwagwah gwah...

#Machoke leave

<Mom> You should go and see your new room upstairs, @s!
<Mom> Dad even bought a new clock for it to help celebrate the big move.

Interviewer: ...

Interviewer: We brought you this report live from in front of Petalburg Gym.
Next up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower in the next star show...

<Mom> Oh... It's already ended.
<Mom> Looks like your dad was on, but we missed his part. What a shame.

<Mom> But that reminds me... One of Dad's friends lives in this town.
<Mom> Professor Birch is his name.
<Mom> He lives right next door, so you should go over and introduce yourself.

<Mrs. Birch> Welcome!

<Mrs. Birch> We have a daughter about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> She has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> She should be in her room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> We have a son who is just about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> He has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> He should be in his room upstairs.

<...> Huh?!
<...> Who...are you?
<...> ...
<...> Oh! You must be @s! Your move was today, huh?
<May> Well, I'm May! Glad to meet you!
<May> I...I actually have this dream of becoming friends with Pokémon all over the world.
<May> And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch— told me about you moving here, @s...
<May> Well, I was hoping you would be nice and we could be friends.
<May> ...B-but that's just silly, isn't it?
<May> I've just met you. Right, @s? So what am I talking about...
<May> Hee hee...
<May> Oh no! I forgot! I was supposed to be going out to help Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
<May> @s, I'll see you later!

#May runs off

#Meeting your rival (Brendan)

<...> Pokémon fully restored... Items all packed, and...
<...> Y-you... Who are you?
<...> @s? Oh, you're the new kid who just moved in next door?!
<...> ad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me you were the kid of a Gym Leader, and I sort of hoped you'd be a guy.
<Brendan> My name's Brendan. Well, I guess we are still neighbors, so...
<Brendan> Nice to meet you! Let's be friends, OK?
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s... Don't you have any Pokémon?
<Brendan> If you want, I can go catch you one.
<Brendan> Aw, wait, I forgot... I'm supposed to be going out to help my dad catch some wild Pokémon.
<Brendan> Some other time, OK?

<Professor Birch> Whew...
<Professor Birch> I went into the tall grass to survey wild Pokémon when I was suddenly jumped!
<Professor Birch> You saved my hide. Thanks a lot!
<Professor Birch> Oh? But you're Norman's kid, @s!
<Professor Birch> I didn't even realize who you were at first.
<Professor Birch> You've grown into quite the young kid.
<Professor Birch> This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.

#Teleports player to lab
<Professor Birch> So, @s! I've heard so much about you from your father.
<Professor Birch> But he said that you don't have your own Pokémon yet.
<Professor Birch> If that's true, that was quite the performance back there!
<Professor Birch> Looks like you really are your father's kid!
<Professor Birch> Oh, yes! To say thanks for rescuing me out there, how about I give you that Pokémon you used earlier?

@s received Treecko!
@s received Torchic!
@s received Mudkip!

<Professor Birch> You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain experience, I think you'll make a pretty excellent Trainer.

<Professor Birch> My girl, May, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.
<Professor Birch> My boy, Brendan, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.

<Professor Birch> It might not be a bad idea for you to head out that way yourself.
<Professor Birch> What do you think?

<Professor Birch> She can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure Brendan'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> He can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Oh, yes!
<Professor Birch> And if you're ever lost along the way, use the AreaNav on your PokéNav Plus!
<Professor Birch> You can use it to see how to get to Route 103, where May ought to be.
<Professor Birch> And if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest back at your new house.

<Shopkeeper> Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart.
<Shopkeeper> From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right?
<Shopkeeper> OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
<Shopkeeper> First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof.
<Shopkeeper> We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
<Shopkeeper> I'd like you to have these as part of a special promotion!

@s obtained Potions!

<Shopkeeper> Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.

#Teleports player and npc to Pokemon Center

<Shopkeeper> And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof!
<Shopkeeper> Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health.
<Shopkeeper> That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk.
<Shopkeeper> Have a great journey!

<May> and this one...and this one, too...
<May> Oh! Hey, @s!
<May> What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
<May> Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle?
<May> I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!

<Brendan> OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s!
<Brendan> Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad?
<Brendan> Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
<Brendan> I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!

#pokeheal
Your team's health was restored!

<May> Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now.
<May> I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
<May> I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
<May> Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!


<Brendan> I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
<Brendan> Look, you just got your Pokémon, right?
<Brendan> And you already have that strong of a bond?
<Brendan> I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, @s. No doubt.
<Brendan> Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab.
<Brendan> You should head back, too, @s!

#After battling rival for the first time
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1472

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat May on your first try.
<Professor Birch> That's amazing! May's been helping with my research for a long time, so she has a pretty long history as a Trainer already.
<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat Brendan on your first try.

<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

@s received a Pokédex!

<Professor Birch> That Pokédex is a high-tech tool that automatically makes a record of any Pokémon you meet or catch.

<Professor Birch> My girl May takes hers with her everywhere she goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever she catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, she comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> My boy Brendan takes his with him everywhere he goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever he catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, he comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> The Pokémon and people you will meet...
<Professor Birch> And the great expanse of nature that lies before you!
<Professor Birch> Experience them both while you fill in your Pokédex. I'd love it if your world seemed wider than ever!
<Professor Birch> Though I'd love it even more if you came back from time to time to show me what progress you've made.
<Professor Birch> ...Arghhh! I'm getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!


<May> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<May> That's great. Just like me!
<May> Then here... I'll give you something, too!
<May> Some Poké Balls that you can use to catch wild Pokémon!

@s obtained Poké Balls!

<May> If you catch a Pokémon in the wild and battle together with it for a while, it will grow stronger for you!
<May> Take that as a bit of advice from a more experienced Trainer like me!
<May> I'm going to get ready to head out from Littleroot soon myself.
<May> I can't wait to see what kind of Pokémon I'm going to meet...


<Brendan> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<Brendan> That's great. Just like me!

Your PokéNav Plus has been updated! The DexNav function has been added to your PokéNav Plus!

<May> The app I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called the DexNav.
<May> It can tell you lots about the Pokémon living in each area and that kind of stuff.
<May> It's a handy app to have if you're trying to catch lots of different Pokémon.
<May> Guess it's about time I use the DexNav to do a little more catching myself!
<May> I'm gonna head that way and see what I find.
<May> @s, you should use those Poké Balls I gave you earlier to do a bit of catching, too!

<Wally> Y-yes... I'm supposed to go stay with my relatives in Verdanturf Town for a while.
<Wally> But I thought I might be lonely by myself, so I wanted to bring a Pokémon with me.
<Wally> But I've never caught a Pokémon by myself...
<Wally> I'm not sure if I can.

<Dad> Mm-hmm. I see.
<Dad> @s! You heard all that, right?
<Dad> You go with Wally, and make sure that he safely catches a Pokémon.
<Dad> Wally, here. I'll lend you one of my Pokémon.

#Wally teleports out

<Dad> Hmm. That boy will be worth keeping an eye on. But for now...
<Dad> @s!
<Dad> If you want to become strong as a Trainer, listen to my advice.
<Dad> First head for Rustboro City, which lies beyond this town.
<Dad> There you should challenge the Gym Leader, Roxanne.
<Dad> After her, go on to the other Pokémon Gyms and defeat their Leaders as well.
<Dad> Collect Badges from them, understand?
<Dad> Of course, I'm a Gym Leader, too. I'm sure we'll battle one day.
<Dad> But that will only be after you've become stronger, @s.

<Cutter> That determined expression...

<Cutter> And your well-trained Pokémon...
<Cutter> You're obviously a skilled Trainer!
<Cutter> No, wait, don't say a word. I can tell just by looking at you.
<Cutter> I'm sure that you will be capable of putting this HM to good use.
<Cutter> No need to be modest or shy. Go on, take it!

@s obtained HM01 Cut!

<Cutter> That's an axe that can chop down prickly trees if the Trainer has earned the Stone Badge.
<Cutter> HMs like this can be used outside of battle, too, with the right Badges!

<...> Hello.
<...> You must be a new challenger.
<Roxanne> I am Roxanne, the Rustboro City Pokémon Gym Leader.
<Roxanne> I became a Gym Leader so that I may apply in battle all that I've learned at the Pokémon Trainers' School.
<Roxanne> If you defeat me in a Pokémon battle, I'll present you with a Gym Badge as proof of your strength as a Trainer.
<Roxanne> Please take up the challenge.
<Roxanne> I look forward to seeing you as a challenger. Until then, farewell.

<Gym Guy> Listen, my friend! Would you like to become the Champion?
<Gym Guy> I'm no Trainer, not me, but I can sure give you winning advice.
<Gym Guy> That's settled, then! We'll aim for the Pokémon Championship together!
<Gym Guy> It's your job as a Trainer to collect Gym Badges, am I right?
<Gym Guy> But Gym Leaders aren't pushovers! And that's where I come in!
<Gym Guy> I'm here to provide expert advice!
<Gym Guy> Roxanne, the Gym Leader here, is a user of Rock-type Pokémon.
<Gym Guy> The Rock type is very durable, but it can't stand Water-type and Grass-type moves.
<Gym Guy> Well, go for it!

#--------------------------
#Dialogue 25 - Rustboro Gym
#Roxanne post-battle

<Roxanne> I understand.
<Roxanne> The Pokémon League's rules state that Trainers receive this if they defeat a Gym Leader.
<Roxanne> Please accept the official Pokémon League Stone Badge.
@s received the Stone Badge from Roxanne.
<Roxanne> The Stone Badge enables Pokémon to use the HM move Cut outside of battle.
<Roxanne> And... Please take this with you, too.

@s obtained TM37 Rock Tomb!

<Roxanne> The move Rock Tomb not only inflicts damage by dropping rocks, it also lowers the target's Speed.
<Roxanne> If you use a TM, it instantly teaches the move to a Pokémon.
<Roxanne> You can use a TM as many times as you want, so please try it out!

<Mr. Stone> So you helped out my staff not just once, but twice!
<Mr. Stone> There's a favor I'd like to ask of a reliable Trainer like you.
<Mr. Stone> Now I want you to know I'm a president you can trust.
<Mr. Stone> I'd never be so mean as to ask a favor for nothing in return.
<Mr. Stone> Here, give me your PokéNav Plus for a moment.

Mr. Stone updated your PokéNav Plus! You can now use the BuzzNav function on your PokéNav Plus!

<Mr. Stone> The function that I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called BuzzNav.
<Mr. Stone> It is an indispensable tool for any Trainer who is traveling out in the world.
<Mr. Stone> Use it, and you'll be able to get the latest news from around the region and from your own friends, anytime and anyplace.

<Brawly> I'm sure this will help your Pokémon bulk up muscle!

<Brawly> Bulk Up temporarily enhances the Pokémon's muscle power.
<Brawly> The move boosts both Attack and Defense stats of the Pokémon.
<Brawly> I can see your talent becoming a giant wave that causes a storm of astonishment with Trainers one day!
<Brawly> I look forward to the day when I can surf your giant wave!
<Brawly> By the way, have you been to Granite Cave? It's located to the north of this town.

<Steven> Why, thank you...
<Steven> It must have been some trouble to track me down. I suppose I must repay you in some way.
<Steven> Let me see...
<Steven> I will give you this TM. Please accept it. It contains my favorite move, Steel Wing.

#View of overhead, Steven looking at the wall

<Steven> If you don't mind me asking... Do you feel anything in particular when you look up at this wall?
<Steven> A primal world, lost thousands of years in the past...
<Steven> A Legendary Pokémon of tremendous power became humanity's greatest threat...
<Steven> The terror aroused by that power is clear to see in this ancient artwork.


<Steven> ...Yes. But not all power is terrible. Your Pokémon are clearly quite capable as well.
<Steven> Looking at you all together... I think that you have in you what it takes to become a Pokémon League Champion.

<Fan Club Chairman> No one! In any contest, my victory is a foregone conclusion!

<Fan Club Chairman> So I now while away my time examining the Pokémon of others.
<Fan Club Chairman> It is marvelous to witness how others have raised Pokémon.
<Fan Club Chairman> The contented faces of properly raised Pokémon...
<Fan Club Chairman> The kind and loving gazes of their Trainers...
<Fan Club Chairman> My heart is overwhelmed—there is so much happiness.
<Fan Club Chairman> Oh my! Excuse me! I seem to have nattered on far too long!
<Fan Club Chairman> Please, do allow me to examine your Pokémon and see how it's grown.

How is your Pokémon growing? Allow me to examine it.
Hmmhm... I see...

#Mehs
Hmmm... It's not bad, but it's not good, either.
You, the Trainer, must put more effort into raising this Pokémon!
For instance, may I suggest that you give it more Pokéblocks?

#if the player's lead Pokémon has at least 200 stats. Is this possible to track?? Could perhaps track if the trainer has earned 200+ points in each category

Your @e, it is growing in a most impressive manner!
It is one fine specimen! But!
If you let it hold this item, it would become even more attractive! Indeed!

Let a Pokémon hold that Red Scarf. Everyone will recognize the coolness of that Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Blue Scarf. Its beauty will be accentuated much more than now!
Let a Pokémon hold that Pink Scarf. It will draw out the cuteness of the Pokémon some more!
Let a Pokémon hold that Green Scarf. That will enhance the cleverness of the Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Yellow Scarf. It will bolster your Pokémon's toughness!

I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to give you! None at all!
After all, you're blessed with the gift of raising Pokémon without resorting to any items!

<...> What do we have here?
<...> I came to see what was taking so long just to steal a few parts, and I find you simps getting beat by this kid?
<...> Heh! That's quite a fierce expression for such a wee little scamp.
<...> That face tells me you're not just another mindless Trainer brat.
<Archie> The name is Archie.
<Archie> The rough-looking lot you see here are members of my team—Team Aqua.
<Archie> So tell me, child...
<Archie> Do you know that Pokémon, people, and all life in this world depend on the sea for life?
<Archie> That's right. The sea is an irreplaceable treasure for every living thing on this planet.
<Archie> But with our selfish extravagance, humanity dirties the great ocean, destroying this source of all life...
<Archie> Day by day, we're all destroying our most precious resource!
<Archie> If we humans suffer from our actions, well, maybe we'll end up getting what we deserve.
<Archie> But what about the Pokémon in our world?
<Archie> The Pokémon that no longer have a place to live because we stole and soiled their seas?
<Archie> The Pokémon that won't have a place to raise their young and watch them grow?
<Archie> We are creating a world in which innocent Pokémon suffer as a result of our actions...
<Archie> And that is something that I can't forgive!
<Archie> That's why I came to a decision, see?
<Archie> The foolish actions of my fellow humans, the seas we have blighted, nature itself...
<Archie> I will return everything to its unspoiled beginnings!
<Archie> ... Heh! It's not like me to talk so much.
<Archie> Never mind, little scamp...
<Archie> I'll withdraw for now and leave you be.
<Archie> But understand this...
<Archie> Get in my way again, and you won't walk away unscathed next time.
<Archie> Remember that, at least!
<Archie> We're moving out, lads!










#Maxie
<...> Now here I was wondering how you could be held up in the simple act of seizing a case.
<...> Do I take it you are being stymied by this child?
<...> Hmm. Though you are but a child, your eyes tell me of your fierce determination.
<...> My heart is pounding in my chest...
<...> Yes, I think I can see why my lowly Grunts could not stand one minute against you.
<Maxie> I am called Maxie.
<Maxie> I stand as the head of Team Magma, a noble organization whose goal is to propel humanity to even greater heights of progress and evolution.
<Maxie> Indeed.
<Maxie> And you are one of the young persons who may shape our society's future.
<Maxie> Considering that fact, I believe I shall educate you in the ways of the world.
<Maxie> The land...
<Maxie> It is the stage upon which humanity stands.
<Maxie> The land exists so we humans might continue onward and upward, stepping into the future...
<Maxie> For us to continue growing and evolving, humans require a grand stage upon which to stand.
<Maxie> A land upon which we can stride forward...
<Maxie> A land we can explore...develop...exploit...
<Maxie> This is the basis for the growth of all human endeavor.
<Maxie> That is why we, Team Magma, must increase the landmass of this world!
<Maxie> Believe that this will lead to a future of eternal happiness for humanity...
<Maxie> And consequently for all life!
<Maxie> Humph. I suppose the concept may still be too difficult for a child to comprehend.
<Maxie> Is that the case?
<Maxie> At least I have tried to open your mind.
<Maxie> I will take my leave for now.
<Maxie> I suggest you take care that you never again stand against Team Magma.
<Maxie> I will not be so lenient the next time.
<Maxie> I implore you to remember that.
<Maxie> We are done here.

<Contest Clerk> Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular!
<Contest Clerk> It looks like you've brought your Contest Pass.
<Contest Clerk> Keep on trying until you become a contest star!
<Contest Clerk> Before we begin, some advice for first-timers...
<Contest Clerk> During the contest, your Pokémon will show the audience just how lovely it is!
<Contest Clerk> First up is the Introduction Round!
<Contest Clerk> The appearance of Pokémon that have raised their Coolness, Cuteness, or other conditions will be judged.
<Contest Clerk> After the Introduction Round, it's time for the Talent Round!
<Contest Clerk> It's a competition to determine how well Pokémon can use their moves over the course of five turns.
<Contest Clerk> Use moves that match the condition of the contest to make the audience go crazy!
<Contest Clerk> If you check the moves of the Pokémon that you want to put in the contest, you can see that they're split into five different conditions, such as Coolness and Cuteness.
<Contest Clerk> If you're in a contest with the same title as that condition, you can use that move to appeal to the crowd!
<Contest Clerk> After you place first in a Normal Rank contest, you can win your way through higher ranks!
<Contest Clerk> Very well...
<Contest Clerk> Right this way, please!

#With a pass, Returning
<Contest Clerk> Rediscover the charm of Pokémon! Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular!

<Lisia> Hi! Have you never joined in a contest?
<Lisia> That's just what I want to hear!
<Lisia> Then let's get this show on the road! This is the Trainer I'm gonna scout today!
<Lisia> And their name is...

<Lisia> @s!
<Lisia> When I took a good look, I could easily see that @s is a powerful Trainer,
<Lisia> with several Badges of their own already!
<Lisia> @s!
<Lisia> You can enjoy Contest Spectaculars at the Pokémon Contest Hall right here.
<Lisia> Now listen up, because I don't just want to see you making your Pokémon strong.
<Lisia> I want to see you bringing out a whole new brilliant side of them to show off!
<Lisia> So here you go! Take these!
<Lisia> This is a Contest Pass, which is the first thing that anyone needs to take part in a Contest Spectacular!
<Lisia> And this one is a Pokéblock Kit, which will let you make Pokéblocks for your Pokémon out of Berries!

@s obtained the Contest Pass!
@s obtained the Pokéblock Kit!

<Lisia> @s's story begins today!
<Lisia> Yep! And this chapter should be titled...

<Lisia> You'd better expect great things from @s, because I do!
<Lisia> That's it for today's Lisia's Miraculous Contest Scouting! See you all next time!

<Lisia> So! If you're taking on a Contest Spectacular, there's something you hafta have from me!

<Lisia> That's a really big deal, you know!

<Lisia> I think you're just the Trainer I've been looking for!

Hi! Have you got a minute?
I just saw the Contest Spectacular.
Your look inspired me. I rushed out and created a matching costume for a Pokémon!
I know a very fashion-conscious Pikachu called Cosplay Pikachu, and I let it wear the costume!
Cosplay Pikachu is a special Pikachu!
It's very, very, very fashionable, and any costume looks fantastic on the Pikachu!
You'll really, really, really stand out if you two go on stage with matching costumes!

<May> Hey, @s! It's been ages!
<May> Nice timing, too. I was just searching for Pokémon, you know?
<May> My dad is always going on about how nature used to be even more diverse, way back in the day.
<May> He says that there used to be way more kinds of Pokémon than there are now!
<May> So that's why we do fieldwork, him and me.
<May> We really want to find out what happened to those Pokémon in the past.
<May> On my journey up to now, I've met a lot of different Pokémon, and I think I've gotten to understand a lot of them, too.
<May> Me and my Pokémon have really grown.
<May> So...
<May> How about a little battle?

pokebattle


<Brendan> Hey, @s. So this is where you've been.
<Brendan> How've things been going?
<Brendan> I was just checking out the Pokémon around here to help with my dad's research.
<Brendan> He says that a long, long time ago, nature used to be way more diverse and there were lots more kinds of Pokémon, too.
<Brendan> My dad and I want to learn more about those Pokémon from the past, you know?
<Brendan> That's why we do fieldwork. And this journey has really helped.
<Brendan> I've met a lot of Pokémon on my way here and learned about them, too.
<Brendan> Which reminds me!
<Brendan> Come on! It's the first time we've met in ages, so let's have a battle!
<Brendan> Show me what you and your team have accomplished on your journey, @s!

<May> And now I think you deserve a reward, too! Here, this is from me!

<May> That's a Dowsing Machine. Try it out—if there's a hidden item anywhere near you, that little thing will react to tell you.
<May> Pay attention, and it'll lead you right to items!
<May> And it's fun to see all those waving bits above your head.
<May> Try it, and I bet you'll be hooked!
<May> See you later then, @s! Let's meet again!
<May> I hope we'll both be able to meet even more Pokémon on our journeys!

#tps May out


<Brendan> Sheesh, @s, when did you go and train your Pokémon up that well?
<Brendan> It's, like, I don't know... It's pretty surprising, OK!
<Brendan> Both our teams look pretty wiped out after that, huh!
<Brendan> Here, let me help them out.

<Brendan> And this is for you.

@s recieved the Dowsing Machine!

<Brendan> That's a Dowsing Machine. Use it to root around for items that aren't visible.
<Brendan> If it senses something nearby, it'll react, see?
<Brendan> Truth is, once I started using it, I got pretty hooked on it. It's addicting!
<Brendan> But I recommend you give it a try.
<Brendan> I guess I'm off to get started surveying the next area then.
<Brendan> I hope you meet a lot of Pokémon, too, @s!

<...> Hahaha! You sure seem to be enjoying it, Wally.
<...> So what would you like to do? Do you want to grab a bite to eat at the Mauville Food Court?
<...> Or maybe we should get you a Bike of your own at Rydel's Cycles.
<...> Would you like that? I bet the exercise would be good for your health.

<Wally> No, thank you! I want to challenge the Gym right away!

<...> What?

<Wally> Let me see... I'm pretty sure the Gym is...
<Wally> Yup! Straight ahead this way! Just through the inner courtyard!

<Wally> Please! You'll let me, won't you?

<Wally's Uncle> Now hold on, Wally...
<Wally's Uncle> It's certainly true that you've grown quite a lot stronger alongside your Pokémon.
<Wally's Uncle> But don't you think that jumping right into challenging a Gym might be pushing it?

<Wally> I'm not pushing it! If it's me and my Ralts, we can beat anyone!
<Wally> Ah! @s!
<Wally> Ralts and I have gotten a lot stronger since we first met. Growing together!
<Wally> I want to prove that to you and my uncle both, @s.
<Wally> Please...help me once more... And have a battle with me!

<Wally> ... I'll go back to Verdanturf...
<Wally> @s, thank you... Being a Trainer is tough, isn't it?
<Wally> It's not enough just to battle with your Pokémon.
<Wally> I can't become a true Trainer like that... Not really...

<Wally's Uncle> Wally, there's no need to get so down on yourself.
<Wally's Uncle> Why, what's keeping you from becoming stronger?
<Wally's Uncle> Nothing is! All you need to do is keep growing.

<Wally> ...

<Wally's Uncle> Come on, let's go home. Everyone's waiting for you.

<Wally> ...Yes, Uncle.
<Wally> @s...
<Wally> I... I'm definitely... I'm going to get stronger. Much, much stronger!
<Wally> I feel like I learned a lot from just one Pokémon battle with you...
<Wally> About my own limits...and Ralts's...
<Wally> So...um... That's why... @s... If it's all right... Could I...
<Wally> Could I call you...my r-riv—
<Wally> Ah, never mind! S-sorry! It was nothing! Please forget about it!
<Wally> Guh...good-bye!

<Wally's Uncle> It just dawned on me that you must be the young trainer who kept an eye out for Wally when he caught his Pokémon.

<Wally's Uncle> If you ever have the time, I'd love it if you'd stop by our home in Verdanturf.
<Wally's Uncle> I'm sure Wally would enjoy it, too.

#Dialogue 63 - Mauville Food Court
#
https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=17655

<Youngster> Hey there, Trainer! This is your first time here, right?
<Youngster> This food court is a bit strange, so there are some rules you have to follow before you eat.
<Youngster> I come here all the time, so I can tell you about them.
<Youngster> Number one! Place your order at the counter!
<Youngster> There are three items on the menu here, so order whatever you like.
<Youngster> When you're done ordering, the restaurant staff will give you a buzzer.
<Youngster> Number two! Sit in a chair while you wait for your food!
<Youngster> It may take a while for your order to be ready. Have a seat and wait.
<Youngster> Here's the important part!
<Youngster> While you're sitting and waiting for your food, others will come and battle you for your seat!
<Youngster> You have to fight back if you want to eat the meal you ordered!
<Youngster> Number three! Eat your food!
<Youngster> When the buzzer goes off, it means that your order is ready to be picked up at the counter.
<Youngster> All that's left to do then is to sit back down and eat!
<Youngster> What do you think? Easy, right?
<Youngster> Well, you've come all the way here, so why don't you order something?
<Youngster> Since it's your first time here, maybe you should order the Village Sub Combo.
<Youngster> That restaurant is a chain from Unova that just opened here!
<Youngster> It's easy to eat, so it's pretty popular with kids who like Single Battles.
<Youngster> All right then, see you later! Enjoy your time at the Mauville Food Court!

#-------------------------------------
#Dialogue 64

Hey there, Trainer! As long as you're here, do you have a minute?
I guess the trend is dying out already.
The line of customers waiting to order Magnemite Croquettes has disappeared.
Magnemite Croquettes are a Mauville specialty.
They're made with batter containing a blend of several kinds of broth, grilled on a piping-hot hot plate, and coated with specially made sweet, sour, spicy sauce from Johto!
They're a cheap gourmet food that's all the rage with couples and young people who like Double Battles.
You should definitely give them a try, too!
Well OK then, see you later!

#-------------------------------------
#Dialogue 65

Oh, Trainer! As long as you're here, do you have a minute?
Maybe it's because we've had fewer amateurs coming in these days...
The line of customers lining up for a Mauville Ramen Bowl has finally cleared out.
The noodles are soft like Jigglypuff's cheeks (not that anyone would ever consider biting them...), the soup is golden like lightning, and the ingredients are piled as high as Mt. Chimney.
It's a local Mauville specialty that even makes discerning people who like Triple Battles say, “Wow!” Mauville Ramen Bowls are an edible legend here at the Mauville Food Court.
You want to try it, don't you?
You have to come prepared if you want to eat a Mauville Ramen Bowl, though...
See you later, Trainer!
I look forward to seeing you again sometime!

<Rydel> Hm, hm... You're saying you came all the way from Littleroot?
<Rydel> My goodness! That's ridiculously far!
<Rydel> If you had one of my Bikes, you could go anywhere easily while feeling the gentle caress of the wind!
<Rydel> I'll tell you what! I'll give you a Bike!
<Rydel> Oh, wait a second! I forgot to tell you that there are two kinds of Bikes!
<Rydel> They are the Mach Bike and the Acro Bike!
<Rydel> Mach Bikes are for cyclists who want to feel the wild, blowing wind as they ride!
<Rydel> Acro Bikes are for those who prefer a technical ride!
<Rydel> I'm a real sweetheart, so you can have whichever one you like! Which one will you choose?
[Mach Bike]   [Acro Bike]

@s chose the Mach Bike.

<Brendan> So it's you, @s.
<Brendan> You see that mountain up there? That's Mt. Chimney.

#Cutscene view

<Brendan> I dunno, but... But seeing it for real is, like...
<Brendan> Like a punch in the gut, you know?
<Brendan> Hope I might get to take the Cable Car up to the top someday...

#Back to normal view

<Brendan> Hey, @s, doesn't your team seem a bit worse for wear?
<Brendan> Here. I'll help them out for you.

#Dialogue 76 - Route 111
#Secret Base Obtaining
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=24761

#This dialogue should probably be reworked to fit the theme of Minecraft and not auto-claim this one bsae due to it being multiplayer friendly

<...> Mmm-mm. I can smell it. I can smell it right here...
<...> The scent of adventure! This is definitely one.
<...> It's gotta be a Secret Spot.
<Aarune> There'll be enough space here to build a crazy super place, or my name's not Aarune!
<Aarune> Yo, my young Pokémon Trainer!
<Aarune> What can I do you for, hmm?
<Aarune> Huh? What d'you mean, you didn't ask for anything?
<Aarune> Bet your heart did! Now, now, no need to be shy!
<Aarune> After all, we managed to meet! The name's Aarune. Put'er there.
<Aarune> Unova-born, and twenty-five years old.
<Aarune> Spent the last 11 years trying to find myself. Just a vagabond in search of dreams.
<Aarune> I'm wandering 'round Hoenn, trying to find a place where I really belong.
<Aarune> That's right! A Super-Secret Base!
<Aarune> You don't know about Secret Bases? What kinda life is that?
<Aarune> Too sad, little kid. Time for a little lecture from Uncle Aarune!
<Aarune> Let's start with what a Secret Base is...
<Aarune> Which is adventure! Romance! Awesome!
<Aarune> For real, it's the best place ever to chill— you, your pals that you let hang out...
<Aarune> Since you've got this chance, you oughta learn how to make one. Take this.

@s obtained SecretPower
tag @s add SecretBase

<Aarune> Secret Power can help you find the entrances to hidden places.
<Aarune> These entrances... They're full of adventure, all right!
<Aarune> That's why I like to throw some spice in there and call 'em Secret Spots!
<Aarune> Like this! See? This right here is a Secret Spot.
<Aarune> Doesn't it look like you could just climb right up in this tree?
<Aarune> This is exactly the kinda place to bust out with Secret Power!

#Changes into tree with vine

<Aarune> Awww yeah! I never get tired of that!
<Aarune> And that's all there is to finding Secret Spots and creating the entrance to a Secret Base.
<Aarune> This move is crucial to having a Secret Base. Don't forget, now!

#tps NPC and player into example base

<Aarune> Mm-hmm! Not a bad layout...
<Aarune> See, behind each Secret Spot, you'll find a space like this.
<Aarune> They come in all kindsa shapes and sizes.
<Aarune> So basically, whenever you find a Secret Spot, you oughta at least check it out with Secret Power!
<Aarune> Just think... Someday this place could be somebody's Secret Base, all decorated and filled with goods and friends...
<Aarune> I'd really love to see it like that.
<Aarune> Wait a sec...
<Aarune> But who in the world are you?
<Aarune> ...
<Aarune> Ahhh! Right! @s! Sorry about that.
<Aarune> I just got on such a roll...
<Aarune> So then, @s! How about I give you one more tip?
<Aarune> When you feel happy about something, you oughta express that feeling.
<Aarune> That's just how we roll in the Secret Base life.
<Aarune> Every day is full of happy adventures! Aw yeah!
<Aarune> Hmm. Now I could go ahead and make a Secret Base right here, but...
<Aarune> I get the feeling that this layout could be even better for you, little kid!
<Aarune> Guess I'm gonna leave this spot for you!

#Sets up PC and decorations

<Aarune> This will be your Secret Base from now on, little pal!
<Aarune> It's yours now, so decorate it, destroy it, do whatever you want!
<Aarune> Whatever floats your boat, right?
<Aarune> Oh, right. Decorating!
<Aarune> See, any Decorations you buy or find around the world you'll use here.
<Aarune> Place 'em around and liven up your base a bit.
<Aarune> Not that you probably have much, right? Here, I'll give you these to get ya started!

@s received Decorations from Aarune!

<Aarune> Oh, RIGHT! One last thing!
<Aarune> You can do more than make your own Secret Base.
<Aarune> You can visit other people's bases for a bit of fun.
<Aarune> If you find a base that belongs to someone else, check it out.
<Aarune> And here's the real point. When you check out someone's base, collect the flag you find next to the PC.
<Aarune> Heh heh... Something good might come of it!
<Aarune> Looks like it's about time for me to hit the road in search of my perfect base!
<Aarune> Good-bye for now, but hopefully I'll see you again, @s.
<Aarune> If you need me for anything, try dropping in at the Secret Base Guild in Fortree!

<May> The road here was pretty long, huh? I got tired enough that I had to take a little break.
<May> @s, your Pokémon look pretty tired themselves. Let me take care of them for a sec.
pokeheal
<May> ...There! That's all better.
<May> I'm on my way to pay a visit to Professor Cozmo.
<May> He's famous for his research on Meteorites.
<May> He was working on a project with my dad—um, I mean, Professor Birch—on how Meteorites might affect Pokémon.
<May> Enough dawdling! I think it's not much farther to Fallarbor.
<May> Let's give it one last push!

#tps out

<Brendan> Hey!
<Brendan> Phew...
<Brendan> It took a long time to make it this far. Even I felt like I needed a little break.
<Brendan> Looks like your team could use one, too, @s. Lemme patch them up for you.
pokeheal
<Brendan> I'm on my way to meet this Professor Cozmo fellow, right?
<Brendan> He's super famous for his research on Meteorites.
<Brendan> He even worked with my dad—I mean, with Professor Birch—on figuring out if Meteorites could have any effect on Pokémon.
<Brendan> OK! Time to get moving again! I think Fallarbor's pretty close now.

<...> So that means you use the Pokémon Storage System I developed.
<...> How I arrived at that conclusion is a simple deductive process.
<...> You spoke to me because you wanted to access something on this PC.
<Lanette> Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Lanette.

<May> Professor Cozmo...
<May> He got abducted by some weird guys calling themselves Team Something or Other...



<Brendan> It's ridiculous...
<Brendan> Professor Cozmo...
<Brendan> They say that he was just up and kidnapped by some nuts calling themselves Team Something or Other...

<Cozmo's Wife> Those shady characters... They called themselves Team Magma.
<Cozmo's Wife> Those shady characters... They called themselves Team Aqua.
<Cozmo's Wife> It seems as though they plan to do something with the Meteorite that the professor has been researching.
<Cozmo's Wife> The professor is just too gullible.
<Cozmo's Wife> If you show the least bit of interest in his research, he would happily go with you anywhere, without question.


<May> @s, please... You've got to help me save him!
<May> They can't be planning to do anything good with Professor Cozmo's research.
<May> We have to do something!
<May> I...I'm going to head after them right away!
<May> Let's meet up at Meteor Falls!

<Brendan> @s... I know it's a lot to ask, but we've gotta help Cozmo!
<Brendan> I can't just stand by here and watch them use his life's work for their own corrupt reasons!

<May> We did it, @s!

<Brendan> All right! We beat 'em!

<Team Magma Admin> You children! I would like you to stay out of my way!
<Team Magma Admin> Team Magma's scientific prowess, Mt. Chimney's energy...
<Team Magma Admin> And the hidden power of the Meteorite!
<Team Magma Admin> If we combine them all, a super-ancient Pokémon...

<Team Aqua Admin> If the tremendous energy of Mt. Chimney and the Meteorite are combined, we of Team Aqua can take a giant step toward the world that we dream of!
<Team Aqua Admin> We won't let ignorant little brats get in our way!

<...> Bwahahahahahaha! You lost to this scamp?
<...> What a pathetic bunch! You lazy stooges will be the downfall of Team Magma!

<...> Hmph... Do these mere children give you so much trouble?

<Team Magma Grunt> Yes, sir!

<Team Aqua Admin> Hey! Grab that Meteorite!
<Team Aqua Grunt> Aye aye!

<Professor Cosmo> Wha-wha-wha-what?!

<Team Magma Grunt> Come now! Hand over the Meteorite!

<Team Aqua Grunt> Come on! Hand over the Meteorite!

<Professor Cosmo> Augh?!

<Brendan> Professor!

<Team Aqua Admin> Ahyahya! The Meteorite is in the palm of my hand!
<Team Aqua Admin> Well, well, well... Adios to each and every one of you!

<Archie> That's right! We're not letting them get away!
<Maxie> Hmm...

<Archie> Oh? What's this?
<Archie> You've got quite a fierce expression on you for such a wee little thing.
<Archie> The name's Archie. I'm the leader of Team Aqua, a group that's working to return the world to a pristine state.
<Archie> One that'll be perfect for Pokémon's survival.
<Archie> Looks like you were getting into it with Team Magma there, 'less my eyes deceive me.
<Archie> It's not like I'm in a position to argue if that's what you're up to, hey?
<Archie> But I'll tell you this much. So remember.
<Archie> If you next get in the way of Team Aqua, you won't get off so lightly.
<Archie> So steer clear and keep your nose clean, scamp!
<Archie> I imagine I'll be seeing you! Waha! Bwahahahahah!

<Maxie> ... My name is Maxie.
<Maxie> I lead an organization known as Team Magma.
<Maxie> We work for the future happiness of all mankind.
<Maxie> From what I have seen here, it appears that you are working against our rivals in Team Aqua.
<Maxie> ...Fine. Amuse yourself with those Team Aqua fools.
<Maxie> But be careful you do not impede our goals.
<Maxie> Be you child or grown, oppose us in the slightest, and I, the great Maxie, will show no mercy!

<May> From the look of them, they kind of seem like bad guys, but...
<May> We've both got to be careful.
<May> Though I'm not worried a bit if it's you and your team, @s!

<Brendan> Those crazy jerks... What do you think they wanted with the professor's Meteorite anyway?
<Brendan> I've gotta say, they sure didn't look like the good guys...but...
<Brendan> I guess we'd both better be careful from here on out.
<Brendan> Not that I'm really worried about you, @s. You and your team'd be fine for sure.

<Professor Cosmo> But I need to thank you, as well. You truly saved me from disaster.
<Professor Cosmo> I hope you'll take this TM as some small form of repayment.

<Maxie> The power contained in the Meteorite...
<Maxie> If we merge the explosive energy contained within the planet's core with the Meteorite's power...
<Maxie> I remember those eyes. And the indomitable will that seems to burn behind them.
<Maxie> Ahhh. Now I recall. You are the one who defied us at Slateport's Oceanic Museum.
<Maxie> And, your presence here tells me that you have defeated Tabitha.
<Maxie> Yes, I see now that the stirring of interest I felt was not misplaced.
<Maxie> Hmph. You show true promise. Fine. I will attempt to educate you.
<Maxie> Thousands of years ago, there lived a most powerful being that was said to be capable of creating new lands on the planet.
<Maxie> The power which we in Team Magma seek—
<Maxie> This power, which can expand the available landmass, belongs to a legendary and super- ancient Pokémon.
<Maxie> Though now it slumbers, having lost the source of its power and been trapped in a deep sleep.
<Maxie> So what is it that we must do to awaken this slumbering giant?
<Maxie> Our research has led us here, to Mt. Chimney.
<Maxie> Yes, here...to this very Meteorite.
<Maxie> If we create the right conditions, we should find ourselves able to alter this Meteorite's qualities.
<Maxie> Yes, even into a Mega Stone.
<Maxie> Even into a Key Stone.
<Maxie> And here, at Mt. Chimney—
<Maxie> Hmph... I should not say too much. That is the end of today's lesson.
<Maxie> Now then. I believe it is time we begin.
<Maxie> The time for the purge has come.
<Maxie> I do believe that I made myself quite clear when we were last in Slateport.
<Maxie> I warned you that any fool standing in our way would be met without mercy!
<Maxie> I will bury you by my own hand.
<Maxie> I hope you appreciate this honor!

<Archie> See, this Meteorite that I just got from good old Professor High-an'-Mighty back there...
<Archie> With the right bit of work, it seems we could turn it into a real nice, valuable bit.
<Archie> Like maybe a Mega Stone.
<Archie> Or maybe...even a Key Stone.
<Archie> And as long as we're here at Mt. Chimney...
<Archie> Hyup! Bwahahahahah! Look what I nearly went an' did!
<Archie> If I give away all my secrets, all the thrill'd be gone from our relationship!
<Archie> I think I'll just leave you hanging here.
<Archie> Well... It's not the details that matter any old how.

<Archie> Huh? If it ain't that little scamp!
<Archie> But blast that Maxie! He just escaped us!
<Archie> And he just left behind the Meteorite that he's been crazy about finding?
<Archie> Can't be—!
<Archie> Could he have found out where the real orbs are hidden?!
<Archie> That sneaky little scientific so-and-so!
<Archie> I'm always left watching his bony backside run two steps ahead of me!

<Maxie> I've seen you before, child.
<Maxie> It seems you are not to be trifled with, if you repelled Archie in battle.
<Maxie> What is that fool up to now?
<Maxie> He abandoned the Meteorite that he sought so persistently?
<Maxie> No!
<Maxie> Could it be possible that he has confirmed the existence of the orbs at last?
<Maxie> Ngh! Again, I find myself outmaneuvered.
<Maxie> What a terrible miscalculation!

#Flannery Pre-Battle

<Flannery> Welcome!
<Flannery> No, wait.
<Flannery> I mean... Puny Trainer, you've done well to make it this far!
<Flannery> Let's see. I'm, uh, honored to be serving as the Gym Leader of...
<Flannery> No, I mean...
<Flannery> I'm Flannery, and I'm in charge here!
<Flannery> Uh... You'd better not underestimate me just 'cause I've only been Leader a short time!
<Flannery> With the skills inherited from my grandfather, I'm gonna, uh, demonstrate the hot moves we've honed in this land!
<Flannery> Haiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

#Dialogue 90 - Lavaridge Gym
#Flannery Post-Battle
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=30632

<Flannery> I...I've only recently become a Gym Leader.
<Flannery> I guess I was trying too hard to be someone I'm not.
<Flannery> When I don't act like myself, no wonder Pokémon that battle at my side get confused.
<Flannery> Thank you for teaching me that. You deserve this.

@s received the Heat Badge from Flannery.

<Flannery> If you have a Heat Badge, it lets Pokémon use the HM move Strength outside of battle.
<Flannery> This is a token of my appreciation. Don't be shy about taking it!

@s obtained TM50 Overheat!
give @s

<Flannery> Overheat is a Fire-type move that inflicts serious damage on the target.
<Flannery> But it also sharply cuts the Sp. Atk of the Pokémon using it.
<Flannery> It might not be suitable for longer battles.

#tp Rival in

<May> @s! Wow, it's a relief to see you in one piece!
<May> Oh, well, you know...
<May> The last time I saw you was right after battling those Team Whatsit people...
<May> So I was a bit worried, thinking about what might have happened to you after that, @s...
<May> ...What? You battled them AGAIN after that?
<May> And you BEAT them! You really are something else, @s.
<May> I-I mean, you and your team are. I'm pretty impressed by you all!
<May> And that pretty stone that's sparkling there...
<May> Is that the Meteorite you got back from them?
<May> Oh, that's right! Here! Here!
<May> I've been thinking of giving these to you.

@s obtained the Go-Goggles!

<May> If you put on those Go-Goggles, you'll be all set heading into the desert on Route 111.
<May> ...Oh! And isn't that— That's Lavaridge's Gym Badge!
<May> So you beat Flannery, too?
<May> I guess you really are training your Pokémon right...
<May> Next up will be challenging your dad, Norman, in Petalburg, right?
<May> I'm headed to Petalburg's Gym next myself...
<May> Do you want to go back together? Back to Petalburg?
[Yes]  [No]


#tp Rival in

<Brendan> @s, hey! So you were all right, huh?
<Brendan> Oh, well, you know...
<Brendan> The last time I saw you, you were mixed up with those “Team Whatsit” people...
<Brendan> So I just wondered if you'd gotten back on the road after that.
<Brendan> It was, like, I don't know...
<Brendan> I guess I was a bit...worried?
<Brendan> What? You battled them AGAIN after that?
<Brendan> And you even managed to beat them?
<Brendan> You really are something else, @s...
<Brendan> You and your Pokémon. Your team.
<Brendan> And that...that sparkle there... Is that the Meteorite you got back from them?
<Brendan> ...Oh, right! I forgot to give you these before.

@s obtained the Go-Goggles!

<Brendan> Keep those with you if you're planning on going into that desert near Route 111.
<Brendan> There should be some Pokémon that only make their habitat in the desert, you know.
<Brendan> You might check 'em out—if you're up to it.
<Brendan> And... Huh? You got the Lavaridge Badge!
<Brendan> So you even beat Flannery, huh? Looks like you've been taking proper care of your Pokémon.
<Brendan> Guess that means...that you'll be headed to Petalburg City next, huh?
<Brendan> To challenge your dad at his Gym?
<Brendan> W-well, if you are... I just happened to be thinking of going to Petalburg myself, so...
<Brendan> How about it? Wanna go back to Petalburg together?
[Yes]  [No]

<Dad> Hm... So you did get four Gym Badges.
<Dad> Then, as I promised, we will have a Pokémon battle.
<Dad> @s...
<Dad> It makes me happier than I can really describe.
<Dad> Being able to have a real battle with my own kid like this.
<Dad> But a battle is a battle!
<Dad> I will do everything within my power as a Gym Leader to win!
<Dad> You'd better give it your best shot, too, @s!

#Normal Post-Battle

<Dad> I can't believe it.
<Dad> I lost to @s?
<Dad> ... ...
<Dad> You've come this far...
<Dad> That's how it is, then! I will give you this.

@s received the Balance Badge from their dad!

<Dad> Having that Badge will ensure that Pokémon that know the HM move Surf will be able to travel over water now.
<Dad> And this is my gift to you, @s.
<Dad> I'm sure you'll be able to use it well.

@s obtained TM67 Retaliate

<Dad> Retaliate will allow you to take revenge for a fallen team member.
<Dad> Its power will be doubled if you have a Pokémon use it in the very next move right after an ally faints.
<Dad> I hope you and your Pokémon will be diligent enough to use it wisely.
<Dad> ...
<Dad> Sigh.
<Dad> As the Gym Leader, I can't express how frustrated I am.
<Dad> But, as a father, it makes me both happy and a little sad. It's odd.
<Dad> ... Come on, @s.
<Dad> I'll see you on your way. Let's get out of here.

<Wally> Ah! @s!
<Wally> Mr. Norman!
<Wally> I haven't seen the two of you in some time.
<Wally> What a coincidence! I just came back to my parents' house to grab something I'd forgotten.

<Dad> You look like you've been working hard, Wally.
<Dad> It's clear even without a battle.

<Wally> R-really? You really think so?
<Wally> Hehe... Thank you! That's so nice of you to say!

<Wally's Dad> As you can see, Wally's health has thoroughly improved.
<Wally's Dad> It's all thanks to you and your father.
<Wally's Dad> You two helped Wally catch his first Pokémon that day.
<Wally's Dad> It's because of you that he has a partner of his own now.
<Wally's Dad> That partner is why he's grown so strong. That's my firm belief. So, I thank you.
#Summons exclamation
<Wally's Dad> Yes, that's it. Sometimes words aren't enough.
<Wally's Dad> It would delight me if you'd take this.

give @s HM03 Surf
@s obtained HM03 Surf!

<Wally's Dad> If you're cleared to use Surf outside of battle, you'll be able to cross seas with your Pokémon.

<Dad> @s...
<Dad> Considering how much you and Wally have grown, you should be able to handle what lies beyond the sea on Route 118 now.
<Dad> There are far stronger Pokémon and Trainers waiting for you on Hoenn's east coast.
<Dad> Continue your journey and your adventures there. I know you'll do your best!

<Wally> Yes, sir!
<Wally> I will do my best to become as strong as @s, sir!
<Wally> I guess I had better start out, then.
<Wally> I'm off for now, Dad! See you next time!
<Wally> Um. Come on, @s! Let's go together!

<Dad> Wally...
<Dad> I look forward to seeing you and your Pokémon grow stronger together.
<Dad> @s? Well, take care of yourself out there.
<Dad> Don't forget to drop by Littleroot to visit your mother from time to time!

<Wally> OK! We're off!

<Wally's Dad> Be safe out there!

<Dad> Learn a lot!

<Wally's Dad> As a father, it makes me happy and a little sad...

<Dad> Hahahah! What a coincidence!
<Dad> I caught myself thinking the same thing.

<Wally's Dad> Hohoho! Is that so?
<Wally's Dad> ... But if only...
<Wally's Dad> If only my boy keeps growing strong and healthy like that...

<Wally> Mr. Norman told us to keep going beyond Route 118, didn't he...
<Wally> Let me check my AreaNav...
<Wally> Route 118 is the one east of Mauville City, huh?
<Wally> @s! Since we're both here anyway, let's go to Mauville together!
<Wally> I'm definitely planning on going to check out Route 118 like your dad said!

#tps player and Wally to Eastern side of Mauville Interior

<Wally> Phew...
<Wally> It's actually pretty far, isn't it? All the way here to Mauville...
<Wally> So that must be Route 118 ahead...
<Wally> I wonder what kind of Pokémon I'll meet there. I can't wait to find out!
<Wally> I'll see you later, @s!
<Wally> I'm going straight to Route 118!
<Wally> Let's definitely have a battle next time we meet! It's a promise, OK?
<Wally> And you can't break a promise!

<Steven> Why, hello.
<Steven> We met in Granite Cave, didn't we?
<Steven> No, I remember it. It's @s... Right?
<Steven> It's good to see that your journey is going well.
<Steven> You know, @s...
<Steven> In this vast world, there are many kinds of Pokémon.
<Steven> They come in many types.
<Steven> Should you raise different types?
<Steven> Or will you only raise Pokémon of a certain type you like?
<Steven> I wonder what you think, as a Pokémon Trainer?
<Steven> Not that it's anything I should be concerning myself with...
<Steven> But somehow I find myself wanting to know what you think.
<Steven> I suppose I should be going. I hope to see you again though.

<Steven> ...Hm?

<Steven> Not quite unease, not quite fear...
<Steven> But there is something...unsettling...
<Steven> It is an odd feeling, as though I am walking in a dream— or an illusion.
<Steven> I once heard an odd fable.
<Steven> It was said that the two Pokémon that live on this island guard some secret about that great form of Evolution: Mega Evolution.
<Steven> Could it be that some dangerous element is here because of that?

<Steven> Come, we should be going.

<Steven> If I were to describe such beauty in terms of a stone, it would be a Water Stone.

<Steven> Isn't its brilliance like that of a Dawn Stone?
<Steven> It is as fantastic as a Steel-type Pokémon...

<Team Magma Grunt> Hah?!
<Team Magma Grunt> M-Mistress Courtney!
<Team Magma Grunt> That pipsqueak over there is the kid that I heard keeps getting in our way!
<Team Magma Grunt> But that enviably unruffled-looking fellow there with him...
<Team Magma Grunt> Hm. I feel like I ought to know him from somewhere...
<Team Magma Grunt> Maybe he's a contest star?

<Team Magma Courtney> Yes.
<Team Magma Courtney> For the time being...get away from me.
<Team Magma Courtney> The Pokémon behind you...
<Team Magma Courtney> Its Mega Stone... No more...no less.
<Team Magma Courtney> That is what... That's what we of Team Magma seek.
<Team Magma Courtney> How about it? Will you get away from me... or not?


<Steven> Team Aqua, is it?
<Steven> So Latias noticed their coming, and that is why it called on us.

<Team Aqua Admin> Huhn?! What's this?! You?!

<Team Aqua Grunt> Huh?!
<Team Aqua Grunt> Mr. Matt, sir!
<Team Aqua Grunt> That pipsqueak over there is the kid that I heard keeps getting in our way!
<Team Aqua Grunt> B-but that rather alluring gentleman with them...
<Team Aqua Grunt> Oh, I feel like I should know him from somewhere...
<Team Aqua Grunt> Maybe he's a contest star?

<Team Aqua Admin> Oh ho! I have no time to worry about that!
<Team Aqua Matt> The name's Matt! That's Team Aqua Admin Matt to you!
<Team Aqua Matt> What I want from you is that Latias behind you there.
<Team Aqua Matt> But that Mega Stone...
<Team Aqua Matt> We of Team Aqua are definitely gonna need the transcendent power of Mega Evolution to achieve our ambitions.
<Team Aqua Matt> How 'bout it? If you get out of our way, we won't rough you up.



<Steven> I'll take part in this battle as well.

<Steven> Let's protect Latios from these beasts together.
<Steven> We cannot allow Latios or even a Mega Stone to fall into the hands of such villains!

<Steven> With the Mega Bracelet that I just gave you and the Mega Stones that a Pokémon may hold,
<Steven> your Pokémon will be able to achieve a powerful boost, quite unlike any usual form of Evolution...
<Steven> but only if you are bound by great affection.
<Steven> You will be able to achieve Mega Evolution.

<Steven> I suggest you try it with Latios the next time that you happen to have the chance in battle.
<Steven> I suggest you try it with Latias the next time that you happen to have the chance in battle.

<Steven> Mega Evolution is a phenomenon that has long been shrouded in mystery.
<Steven> What is a Mega Stone? What is a Key Stone?
<Steven> The process by which bonds between Pokémon and people manifest in tangible power...
<Steven> How do we explain that?
<Steven> I hope that the Mega Bracelet I just gave you might bring us one step closer to finding the answer to these questions.
<Steven> If that settles that... Should we be heading back?

Speaking of Shaymin, do you have a Gracidea?
I have many Gracidea right now, so I'll give you one.

In the Sinnoh region, there's an old custom that they give a bouquet of Gracidea to convey gratitude.
In other words, if you give Gracidea, you can express your feeling even without saying it.
