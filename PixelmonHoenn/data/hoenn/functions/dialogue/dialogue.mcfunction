#Thinking for these split Brendan/May dialogues if one is significantly longer than the other, the shorter one can add time at the end to complete the dialogue, so they're consistent between players

#Dialogue 1 - After spawn lobby
#Professor Birch's Opening Speech
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=130

<...> Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
<...> Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
<...> My name is Birch.

#Player sets down their PokeNav

<Professor Birch> But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor.
<Professor Birch> And this...is what we call a “Pokémon.”
<Professor Birch> This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times playing together as friends, and at times helping one another out.
<Professor Birch> And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling others like us!
<Professor Birch> But as close as we are, we don't know everything about Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> In fact, there are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon mysteries. But that's enough about me!
<Professor Birch> What about you?
<Professor Birch> Will you give me your name?
<Professor Birch> So you're @s?
<Professor Birch> Ah... I see!
<Professor Birch> You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
<Professor Birch> Are you ready?
<Professor Birch> Your very own adventure is now about to unfold!
<Professor Birch> Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon where dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
<Professor Birch> I expect we'll be meeting again soon. Come see me in my Pokémon Lab!

#Dialogue 2 - Littleroot Town
#Mom outside of house
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=292

<Mom> @s! You're here at last!
<Mom> Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way?
<Mom> Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think?
<Mom> This is going to be our new home!
<Mom> It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think?
<Mom> And you get your own room this time, @s! Come on. You have to see the inside!

#teleports player inside

#tps mom out

<Mom> See, @s? Isn't it nice in here, too?
<Mom> The moving company's Pokémon even help with the unpacking and cleanup. They really make moving a cinch!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...

#Spawn exclamation above Mom

<Mom> Thanks for all the hard work! We really appreciate it!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...
<Machoke> Gwagwah gwah...

#Machoke leave

<Mom> You should go and see your new room upstairs, @s!
<Mom> Dad even bought a new clock for it to help celebrate the big move.

#Dialogue 3 - Littleroot Town
#After player has visited their room upstairs
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=438

<Mom> Oh! @s! @s!!!
<Mom> Quick! Come quickly!
<Mom> It's the Petalburg Gym! Maybe Dad will be on TV!

Interviewer: ...

Interviewer: We brought you this report live from in front of Petalburg Gym.
Next up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower in the next star show...

<Mom> Oh... It's already ended.
<Mom> Looks like your dad was on, but we missed his part. What a shame.

<Mom> But that reminds me... One of Dad's friends lives in this town.
<Mom> Professor Birch is his name.
<Mom> He lives right next door, so you should go over and introduce yourself.

#Dialogue 4 - Littleroot Town
#Player entering their rival's house
https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=491

<..> Oh, hello. And you are?
<Mrs. Birch> ... Oh, you're @s, our new next-door neighbor!
<Mrs. Birch> Welcome!

<Mrs. Birch> We have a daughter about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> She has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> She should be in her room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> We have a son who is just about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> He has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> He should be in his room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> I hope you'll go and introduce yourself!

#Dialogue 5 - Littleroot Town

<...> Pokémon fully restored, items all ready, and...

#Spawn Exclamation

<...> Huh?!
<...> Who...are you?
<...> ...
<...> Oh! You must be @s! Your move was today, huh?
<May> Well, I'm May! Glad to meet you!
<May> I...I actually have this dream of becoming friends with Pokémon all over the world.
<May> And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch— told me about you moving here, @s...
<May> Well, I was hoping you would be nice and we could be friends.
<May> ...B-but that's just silly, isn't it?
<May> I've just met you. Right, @s? So what am I talking about...
<May> Hee hee...
<May> Oh no! I forgot! I was supposed to be going out to help Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
<May> @s, I'll see you later!

#May runs off

#-----------------------------
#Meeting your rival (Brendan)

<...> Pokémon fully restored... Items all packed, and...
<...> Y-you... Who are you?
<...> @s? Oh, you're the new kid who just moved in next door?!
<...> ad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me you were the kid of a Gym Leader, and I sort of hoped you'd be a guy.
<Brendan> My name's Brendan. Well, I guess we are still neighbors, so...
<Brendan> Nice to meet you! Let's be friends, OK?
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s... Don't you have any Pokémon?
<Brendan> If you want, I can go catch you one.
<Brendan> Aw, wait, I forgot... I'm supposed to be going out to help my dad catch some wild Pokémon.
<Brendan> Some other time, OK?

#Brendan runs off

#Dialogue 6 - Route 101
#Professor Birch pre-picking starters
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=683

<Youngster> I think I hear someone screaming up ahead!
<Youngster> What should I do? What should we do?
<Youngster> Somebody has to go help...

H-help me!

<Professor Birch> Halloo! You over there!
<Professor Birch> Please! Help me out!
<Professor Birch> In my Bag! There are some Poké Balls!

#Dialogue 7 - Route 101
#After battling Poochyena
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=796

<Professor Birch> Whew...
<Professor Birch> I went into the tall grass to survey wild Pokémon when I was suddenly jumped!
<Professor Birch> You saved my hide. Thanks a lot!
<Professor Birch> Oh? But you're Norman's kid, @s!
<Professor Birch> I didn't even realize who you were at first.
<Professor Birch> You've grown into quite the young kid.
<Professor Birch> This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.

#Teleports player to lab
<Professor Birch> So, @s! I've heard so much about you from your father.
<Professor Birch> But he said that you don't have your own Pokémon yet.
<Professor Birch> If that's true, that was quite the performance back there!
<Professor Birch> Looks like you really are your father's kid!
<Professor Birch> Oh, yes! To say thanks for rescuing me out there, how about I give you that Pokémon you used earlier?

@s received Treecko!
@s received Torchic!
@s received Mudkip!

<Professor Birch> You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain experience, I think you'll make a pretty excellent Trainer.

<Professor Birch> My girl, May, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.
<Professor Birch> My boy, Brendan, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.

<Professor Birch> It might not be a bad idea for you to head out that way yourself.
<Professor Birch> What do you think?
[Yes]     [No]

No dialogue:
Oh, don't be that way! You should go meet my kid.

#Dialogue 8 - Birch's Lab

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure May'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> She can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure Brendan'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> He can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Oh, yes!
<Professor Birch> And if you're ever lost along the way, use the AreaNav on your PokéNav Plus!
<Professor Birch> You can use it to see how to get to Route 103, where May ought to be.
<Professor Birch> And if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest back at your new house.

#Dialogue 9 - Oldale Town
#Shopkeeper showing the Mart
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1019

<Shopkeeper> Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart.
<Shopkeeper> From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right?
<Shopkeeper> OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
<Shopkeeper> First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof.
<Shopkeeper> We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
<Shopkeeper> I'd like you to have these as part of a special promotion!

@s obtained Potions!

<Shopkeeper> Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.

#Teleports player and npc to Pokemon Center

<Shopkeeper> And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof!
<Shopkeeper> Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health.
<Shopkeeper> That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk.
<Shopkeeper> Have a great journey!

#Dialogue 10 - Route 103
#First battle with Rival
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1284

<May> Let's see... On Route 103, I found this Pokémon...
<May> and this one...and this one, too...
<May> Oh! Hey, @s!
<May> What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
<May> Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle?
<May> I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!

<Brendan> OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s!
<Brendan> Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad?
<Brendan> Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
<Brendan> I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!

#Dialogue 11 - Route 104
#Post-battle with Rival


<May> It was a good battle. Thanks! Let me heal up both our parties real quick.
<Brendan> It was a good battle. Thanks! Here! Lemme heal up both our parties real quick.

#pokeheal
Your team's health was restored!

<May> Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now.
<May> I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
<May> I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
<May> Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!


<Brendan> I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
<Brendan> Look, you just got your Pokémon, right?
<Brendan> And you already have that strong of a bond?
<Brendan> I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, @s. No doubt.
<Brendan> Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab.
<Brendan> You should head back, too, @s!
