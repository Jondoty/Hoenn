#Dialogue 1 - After spawn lobby
#Professor Birch's Opening Speech
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=130

<...> Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
<...> Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
<...> My name is Birch.

#Player sets down their PokeNav

<Professor Birch> But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor.
<Professor Birch> And this...is what we call a “Pokémon.”
<Professor Birch> This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times playing together as friends, and at times helping one another out.
<Professor Birch> And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling others like us!
<Professor Birch> But as close as we are, we don't know everything about Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> In fact, there are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon.
<Professor Birch> I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon mysteries. But that's enough about me!
<Professor Birch> What about you?
<Professor Birch> Will you give me your name?
<Professor Birch> So you're @s?
<Professor Birch> Ah... I see!
<Professor Birch> You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
<Professor Birch> Are you ready?
<Professor Birch> Your very own adventure is now about to unfold!
<Professor Birch> Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon where dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
<Professor Birch> I expect we'll be meeting again soon. Come see me in my Pokémon Lab!

<Mom> @s! You're here at last!
<Mom> Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way?
<Mom> Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think?
<Mom> This is going to be our new home!
<Mom> It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think?
<Mom> And you get your own room this time, @s! Come on. You have to see the inside!

#teleports player inside

#tps mom out

<Mom> See, @s? Isn't it nice in here, too?
<Mom> The moving company's Pokémon even help with the unpacking and cleanup. They really make moving a cinch!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...

#Spawn exclamation above Mom

<Mom> Thanks for all the hard work! We really appreciate it!

<Machoke> Graoh, graoh, graoh...
<Machoke> Gwagwah gwah...

#Machoke leave

<Mom> You should go and see your new room upstairs, @s!
<Mom> Dad even bought a new clock for it to help celebrate the big move.

Interviewer: ...

Interviewer: We brought you this report live from in front of Petalburg Gym.
Next up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower in the next star show...

<Mom> Oh... It's already ended.
<Mom> Looks like your dad was on, but we missed his part. What a shame.

<Mom> But that reminds me... One of Dad's friends lives in this town.
<Mom> Professor Birch is his name.
<Mom> He lives right next door, so you should go over and introduce yourself.

<Mrs. Birch> Welcome!

<Mrs. Birch> We have a daughter about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> She has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> She should be in her room upstairs.

<Mrs. Birch> We have a son who is just about the same age as you.
<Mrs. Birch> He has been so excited about making a new friend.
<Mrs. Birch> He should be in his room upstairs.

<...> Huh?!
<...> Who...are you?
<...> ...
<...> Oh! You must be @s! Your move was today, huh?
<May> Well, I'm May! Glad to meet you!
<May> I...I actually have this dream of becoming friends with Pokémon all over the world.
<May> And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch— told me about you moving here, @s...
<May> Well, I was hoping you would be nice and we could be friends.
<May> ...B-but that's just silly, isn't it?
<May> I've just met you. Right, @s? So what am I talking about...
<May> Hee hee...
<May> Oh no! I forgot! I was supposed to be going out to help Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
<May> @s, I'll see you later!

#May runs off

#Meeting your rival (Brendan)

<...> Pokémon fully restored... Items all packed, and...
<...> Y-you... Who are you?
<...> @s? Oh, you're the new kid who just moved in next door?!
<...> ad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me you were the kid of a Gym Leader, and I sort of hoped you'd be a guy.
<Brendan> My name's Brendan. Well, I guess we are still neighbors, so...
<Brendan> Nice to meet you! Let's be friends, OK?
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s... Don't you have any Pokémon?
<Brendan> If you want, I can go catch you one.
<Brendan> Aw, wait, I forgot... I'm supposed to be going out to help my dad catch some wild Pokémon.
<Brendan> Some other time, OK?

<Professor Birch> Whew...
<Professor Birch> I went into the tall grass to survey wild Pokémon when I was suddenly jumped!
<Professor Birch> You saved my hide. Thanks a lot!
<Professor Birch> Oh? But you're Norman's kid, @s!
<Professor Birch> I didn't even realize who you were at first.
<Professor Birch> You've grown into quite the young kid.
<Professor Birch> This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.

#Teleports player to lab
<Professor Birch> So, @s! I've heard so much about you from your father.
<Professor Birch> But he said that you don't have your own Pokémon yet.
<Professor Birch> If that's true, that was quite the performance back there!
<Professor Birch> Looks like you really are your father's kid!
<Professor Birch> Oh, yes! To say thanks for rescuing me out there, how about I give you that Pokémon you used earlier?

@s received Treecko!
@s received Torchic!
@s received Mudkip!

<Professor Birch> You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain experience, I think you'll make a pretty excellent Trainer.

<Professor Birch> My girl, May, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.
<Professor Birch> My boy, Brendan, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me.

<Professor Birch> It might not be a bad idea for you to head out that way yourself.
<Professor Birch> What do you think?

<Professor Birch> She can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Great! I'm sure Brendan'll be happy to hear that, too.
<Professor Birch> He can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.

<Professor Birch> Oh, yes!
<Professor Birch> And if you're ever lost along the way, use the AreaNav on your PokéNav Plus!
<Professor Birch> You can use it to see how to get to Route 103, where May ought to be.
<Professor Birch> And if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest back at your new house.

<Shopkeeper> Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart.
<Shopkeeper> From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right?
<Shopkeeper> OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
<Shopkeeper> First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof.
<Shopkeeper> We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
<Shopkeeper> I'd like you to have these as part of a special promotion!

@s obtained Potions!

<Shopkeeper> Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.

#Teleports player and npc to Pokemon Center

<Shopkeeper> And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof!
<Shopkeeper> Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health.
<Shopkeeper> That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk.
<Shopkeeper> Have a great journey!

<May> and this one...and this one, too...
<May> Oh! Hey, @s!
<May> What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
<May> Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle?
<May> I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!

<Brendan> OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
<Brendan> Huh? Hey, @s!
<Brendan> Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad?
<Brendan> Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
<Brendan> I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!

#pokeheal
Your team's health was restored!

<May> Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now.
<May> I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
<May> I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
<May> Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!


<Brendan> I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
<Brendan> Look, you just got your Pokémon, right?
<Brendan> And you already have that strong of a bond?
<Brendan> I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, @s. No doubt.
<Brendan> Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab.
<Brendan> You should head back, too, @s!

#After battling rival for the first time
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=1472

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat May on your first try.
<Professor Birch> That's amazing! May's been helping with my research for a long time, so she has a pretty long history as a Trainer already.
<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

<Professor Birch> So I hear you beat Brendan on your first try.

<Professor Birch> Mm-hmm! I think that settles it!
<Professor Birch> @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

@s received a Pokédex!

<Professor Birch> That Pokédex is a high-tech tool that automatically makes a record of any Pokémon you meet or catch.

<Professor Birch> My girl May takes hers with her everywhere she goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever she catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, she comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> My boy Brendan takes his with him everywhere he goes.
<Professor Birch> Whenever he catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, he comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

<Professor Birch> The Pokémon and people you will meet...
<Professor Birch> And the great expanse of nature that lies before you!
<Professor Birch> Experience them both while you fill in your Pokédex. I'd love it if your world seemed wider than ever!
<Professor Birch> Though I'd love it even more if you came back from time to time to show me what progress you've made.
<Professor Birch> ...Arghhh! I'm getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!


<May> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<May> That's great. Just like me!
<May> Then here... I'll give you something, too!
<May> Some Poké Balls that you can use to catch wild Pokémon!

@s obtained Poké Balls!

<May> If you catch a Pokémon in the wild and battle together with it for a while, it will grow stronger for you!
<May> Take that as a bit of advice from a more experienced Trainer like me!
<May> I'm going to get ready to head out from Littleroot soon myself.
<May> I can't wait to see what kind of Pokémon I'm going to meet...


<Brendan> Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too!
<Brendan> That's great. Just like me!

Your PokéNav Plus has been updated! The DexNav function has been added to your PokéNav Plus!

<May> The app I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called the DexNav.
<May> It can tell you lots about the Pokémon living in each area and that kind of stuff.
<May> It's a handy app to have if you're trying to catch lots of different Pokémon.
<May> Guess it's about time I use the DexNav to do a little more catching myself!
<May> I'm gonna head that way and see what I find.
<May> @s, you should use those Poké Balls I gave you earlier to do a bit of catching, too!

<Wally> Y-yes... I'm supposed to go stay with my relatives in Verdanturf Town for a while.
<Wally> But I thought I might be lonely by myself, so I wanted to bring a Pokémon with me.
<Wally> But I've never caught a Pokémon by myself...
<Wally> I'm not sure if I can.

<Dad> Mm-hmm. I see.
<Dad> @s! You heard all that, right?
<Dad> You go with Wally, and make sure that he safely catches a Pokémon.
<Dad> Wally, here. I'll lend you one of my Pokémon.

#Wally teleports out

<Dad> Hmm. That boy will be worth keeping an eye on. But for now...
<Dad> @s!
<Dad> If you want to become strong as a Trainer, listen to my advice.
<Dad> First head for Rustboro City, which lies beyond this town.
<Dad> There you should challenge the Gym Leader, Roxanne.
<Dad> After her, go on to the other Pokémon Gyms and defeat their Leaders as well.
<Dad> Collect Badges from them, understand?
<Dad> Of course, I'm a Gym Leader, too. I'm sure we'll battle one day.
<Dad> But that will only be after you've become stronger, @s.

<Team Aqua Grunt> I'll continue investigating that energy we detected.

#position 2

<Team Aqua Grunt> ... ...Phew!
<Team Aqua Grunt> But that kid sure had some promise as a Trainer, I'd say.

<May> So you made it here to Rustboro, too, @s.

tp @s -2650 122 -534 154 32
<May> It's really big here, isn't it? Littleroot can't even compare.

tp @s -2687 87 -656 -144 28
<May> Oh, and @s, have you heard? There's a Pokémon Gym here, too!




<Brendan> So you made it here to Rustboro, too, @s.
tp @s -2650 122 -534 154 32
<Brendan> It's a real city, huh? Nothing like Littleroot.

<Brendan> Oh, did you know? There's a Pokémon Gym here, too.

<May> Once I catch a couple more Pokémon, I'll be sure to take it on with my team! See you later!
<Brendan> Soon as I gather a few more Pokémon, I'll be trying my team against it! See ya!

#Dialogue 21 - Rustboro City
#Cut HM Obtaining
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=6046


<Cutter> That determined expression...
<Cutter> That limber way you move...
<Cutter> And your well-trained Pokémon...
<Cutter> You're obviously a skilled Trainer!
<Cutter> No, wait, don't say a word. I can tell just by looking at you.
<Cutter> I'm sure that you will be capable of putting this HM to good use.
<Cutter> No need to be modest or shy. Go on, take it!

@s obtained HM01 Cut!

<Cutter> That's an axe that can chop down prickly trees if the Trainer has earned the Stone Badge.
<Cutter> HMs like this can be used outside of battle, too, with the right Badges!

#Dialogue 22 - Rustboro Gym
#Roxanne introducing herself
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=6461


<...> Hello.
<...> You must be a new challenger.
<Roxanne> I am Roxanne, the Rustboro City Pokémon Gym Leader.
<Roxanne> I became a Gym Leader so that I may apply in battle all that I've learned at the Pokémon Trainers' School.
<Roxanne> If you defeat me in a Pokémon battle, I'll present you with a Gym Badge as proof of your strength as a Trainer.
<Roxanne> Please take up the challenge.
<Roxanne> I look forward to seeing you as a challenger. Until then, farewell.

#Dialogue 23 - Rustboro Gym
#Gym Guy first introduction
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=6485

<Gym Guy> Yo, how's it going?
<Gym Guy> Listen, my friend! Would you like to become the Champion?
<Gym Guy> I'm no Trainer, not me, but I can sure give you winning advice.
<Gym Guy> That's settled, then! We'll aim for the Pokémon Championship together!
<Gym Guy> It's your job as a Trainer to collect Gym Badges, am I right?
<Gym Guy> But Gym Leaders aren't pushovers! And that's where I come in!
<Gym Guy> I'm here to provide expert advice!
<Gym Guy> Roxanne, the Gym Leader here, is a user of Rock-type Pokémon.
<Gym Guy> The Rock type is very durable, but it can't stand Water-type and Grass-type moves.
<Gym Guy> Well, go for it!

#Roxanne pre-battle
#https://youtu.be/MgkqxXCmrtI?t=6726

<Roxanne> Just as I expected...
<Roxanne> I knew you and your Pokémon would be able to get this far.
<Roxanne> Now, would you kindly demonstrate how you battle with your Pokémon?

#--------------------------
#Dialogue 25 - Rustboro Gym
#Roxanne post-battle

<Roxanne> I understand.
<Roxanne> The Pokémon League's rules state that Trainers receive this if they defeat a Gym Leader.
<Roxanne> Please accept the official Pokémon League Stone Badge.
@s received the Stone Badge from Roxanne.
<Roxanne> The Stone Badge enables Pokémon to use the HM move Cut outside of battle.
<Roxanne> And... Please take this with you, too.

@s obtained TM37 Rock Tomb!

<Roxanne> The move Rock Tomb not only inflicts damage by dropping rocks, it also lowers the target's Speed.
<Roxanne> If you use a TM, it instantly teaches the move to a Pokémon.
<Roxanne> You can use a TM as many times as you want, so please try it out!
