Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.
Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.
Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.
Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.
Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.
This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.
Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.
Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.
Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.
Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.
Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.
This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace is impossible.
This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks. These appear to become electrically charged during the night while Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity when it is dozy after waking up.
This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness. Raichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity.
Sandshrew has a very dry hide that is extremely tough. The Pokémon can roll into a ball that repels any attack. At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep.
Sandslash can roll up its body as if it were a ball covered with large spikes. In battle, this Pokémon will try to make the foe flinch by jabbing it with its spines. It then leaps at the stunned foe to tear wildly with its sharp claws.
Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.
When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.
Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.
Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.
Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.
Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.
On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.
Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.
Inside Vulpix's body burns a flame that never goes out. During the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this Pokémon releases flames from its mouth to prevent its body from growing too hot.
Legend has it that Ninetales came into being when nine wizards possessing sacred powers merged into one. This Pokémon is highly intelligent—it can understand human speech.
When this Pokémon sings, it never pauses to breathe. If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life.
Wigglytuff's body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply, this Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end. Once inflated, Wigglytuff bounces along lightly like a balloon.
Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.
Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks the victim's blood. It becomes active on inky dark moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon.
Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself. During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon's feet are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots of trees.
From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.
Vileplume has the world's largest petals. They are used to attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.
Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine for extending life.
Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once.
Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.
Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.
Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple— wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing delicious vegetables.
Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light.
Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness. The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the Pokémon's surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers.
If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can't remember having done so. It apparently can't form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep.
Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims effortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues people from wrecked ships floundering in high seas.
When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath.
When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time.
Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything, this Pokémon won't forget the scent, no matter what. It uses its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of other living things.
Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon's body is its source of power.
Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the Pokémon's spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it.
The surface of Poliwhirl's body is always wet and slick with a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle.
Poliwrath's highly developed, brawny muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong, this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean without effort.
Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day. If it doesn't, this Pokémon loses its ability to use telekinetic powers. If it is attacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping.
Kadabra holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used to amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the Pokémon is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its telekinetic powers.
Alakazam's brain continually grows, infinitely multiplying brain cells. This amazing brain gives this Pokémon an astoundingly high IQ of 5,000. It has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world.
Machop exercises by hefting around a Graveler as if it were a barbell. There are some Machop that travel the world in a quest to master all kinds of martial arts.
Machoke undertakes bodybuilding every day even as it helps people with tough, physically demanding labor. On its days off, this Pokémon heads to the fields and mountains to exercise and train.
Machamp is known as the Pokémon that has mastered every kind of martial arts. If it grabs hold of the foe with its four arms, the battle is all but over. The hapless foe is thrown far over the horizon.
Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.
Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.
Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.

The guardians of an ancient city, they use their psychic power to attack enemies that invade their territory.
These Pokémon arose from the spirits of people interred in graves. Each retains memories of its former life.
It has been said that they swallow those who get too close and turn them into mummies. They like to eat gold nuggets.
About 100 million years ago, these Pokémon swam in oceans. It is thought they also went on land to attack prey.
They can live both in the ocean and on land. A slap from one of them is enough to open a hole in the bottom of a tanker.
Revived from a fossil, this Pokémon is thought to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon.
They are intelligent and will cooperate to catch prey. From the ground, they use a running start to take flight.
The combination of garbage bags and industrial waste caused the chemical reaction that created this Pokémon.
It clenches opponents with its left arm and finishes them off with foul-smelling poison gas belched from its mouth.
It changes so it looks just like its foe, tricks it, and then uses that opportunity to flee.
Each has the ability to fool a large group of people simultaneously. They protect their lair with illusory scenery.
Minccino greet each other by grooming one another thoroughly with their tails.
Their white fur feels amazing to touch. Their fur repels dust and prevents static electricity from building up.
Their ribbonlike feelers increase their psychic power. They are always staring at something.
Starlight is the source of their power. At night, they mark star positions by using psychic power to float stones.
Starry skies thousands of light-years away are visible in the space distorted by their intense psychic power.
Because their bodies are enveloped in a special liquid, they are fine in any environment, no matter how severe.
Since they have two divided brains, at times they suddenly try to take two different actions at once.

These mysterious Pokémon evolve when they receive electrical stimulation while they are in the same place as Shelmet.
Wearing the shell covering they stole from Shelmet, they defend themselves and attack with two lances.
It lures people in with its Poké Ball pattern, then releases poison spores. Why it resembles a Poké Ball is unknown.
They show off their Poké Ball caps to lure prey, but very few Pokémon are fooled by this.
They paralyze prey with poison, then drag them down to their lairs, five miles below the surface.
Its body is mostly seawater. It's said there's a castle of ships Jellicent have sunk on the seafloor.
Floating in the open sea is how they live. When they find a wounded Pokémon, they embrace it and bring it to shore.
Since it can't generate its own electricity, it sticks onto large-bodied Pokémon and absorbs static electricity.
They employ an electrically charged web to trap their prey. While it is immobilized by shock, they leisurely consume it.
When threatened, it attacks by shooting a barrage of spikes, which gives it a chance to escape by rolling away.
By swinging around its three spiky feelers and shooting spikes, it can obliterate an opponent.
Interlocking two bodies and spinning around generates the energy they need to live.
By changing the direction in which it rotates, it communicates its feelings to others. When angry, it rotates faster.
The gear with the red core is rotated at high speed for a rapid energy charge.
While one alone doesn't have much power, a chain of many Tynamo can be as powerful as lightning.
It wraps itself around its prey and paralyzes it with electricity from the round spots on its sides. Then it chomps.
With their sucker mouths, they suck in prey. Then they use their fangs to shock the prey with electricity.

Their tusks can shatter rocks. Territory battles between Fraxure can be intensely violent.
They are kind but can be relentless when defending territory. They challenge foes with tusks that can cut steel.
Its nose is always running. It sniffs the snot back up because the mucus provides the raw material for its moves.
They love the cold seas of the north. They create pathways across the ocean waters by freezing their own breath.

When it and Karrablast are together, and both receive electrical stimulation, they both evolve.
Having removed its heavy shell, it becomes very light and can fight with ninja-like movements.
Its skin is very hard, so it is unhurt even if stepped on by sumo wrestlers. It smiles when transmitting electricity.

It wields the fur on its arms like a whip. Its arm attacks come with such rapidity that they cannot even be seen.
It races through narrow caves, using its sharp claws to catch prey. The skin on its face is harder than a rock.
The energy that burns inside it enables it to move, but no one has yet been able to identify this energy.
It is said that Golurk were ordered to protect people and Pokémon by the ancient people who made them.

They crush berries with their talons. They bravely stand up to any opponent, no matter how strong it is.
For the sake of its friends, this brave warrior of the sky will not stop battling, even if injured.
Its wings are too tiny to allow it to fly. As the time approaches for it to evolve, it discards the bones it was wearing.

Using their very hot, flame-covered tongues, they burn through Durant's steel bodies and consume their insides.
Individuals each play different roles in driving Heatmor, their natural predator, away from their colony.
They cannot see, so they tackle and bite to learn about their surroundings. Their bodies are covered in wounds.
The two heads do not get along. Whichever head eats more than the other gets to be the leader.
The heads on their arms do not have brains. They use all three heads to consume and destroy everything.
Said to have been born from the sun, it spews fire from its horns and encases itself in a cocoon of fire when it evolves.

Its Tackle is forceful enough to flip a 50-ton tank. It shields its allies from danger with its own body.
Eating a twig fills it with energy, and its roomy ears give vent to air hotter than 390 degrees Fahrenheit.
It has a twig stuck in its tail. With friction from its tail fur, it sets the twig on fire and launches into battle.
It gazes into the flame at the tip of its branch to achieve a focused state, which allows it to see into the future.
It secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take when attacked.
It can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control, hitting empty cans up to a hundred feet away.
It creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.

In the fever of an exciting battle, it showers embers from the gaps between its feathers and takes to the air.
When under attack from bird Pokémon, it spews a poisonous black powder that causes paralysis on contact.
It lives hidden within thicket shadows. When predators attack, it quickly bristles the fur covering its body in an effort to threaten them.
Vivillon with many different patterns are found all over the world. These patterns are affected by the climate of their habitat.
The stronger the opponent it faces, the more heat surges from its mane and the more power flows through its body.
The male with the largest mane of fire is the leader of the pride.
It draws out and controls the hidden power of flowers. The flower Flabébé holds is most likely part of its body.
It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws out the hidden power of flowers to battle.
It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory, and it obtains power from basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants.
Thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live in harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition.
It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by subtle shifts in the grip on its horns. This empathic sense lets them run as if one being.
It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark.
Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won't put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies.
Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements.
The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out.
When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust.
Apparently this Pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force.
When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons.
Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon.

Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock.
When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle.
Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off.
Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory.
They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol.
Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.
They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement.

Counting the roof, he tripled the area of the city. And the population has QUADRUPLED! Maybe you can make smart use of your vertical space like he did!

I've got a little brother, too, so I know eeeee-zackly what you mean, friend! How about this? You know the Gym Leaders in Mossdeep, Liza and Tate? Fact is, those two are complete opposites when it comes to personality and tastes and whatnot! Tate is a calm kid and loves to eat sweets, while rambunctious Liza loves spicy food! That's just how they are! But they each rely on the other's strengths to the fullest in Double Battles! Spending time with someone who likes different stuff than you is a chance to experience more and have a richer life! Sorry for dropping philosophy on you, but together, you can both grow more!

But really, the most important things have gotta be a balanced diet and enough sleep. I'm backing you all the way, so hold on tight to your dreams! See ya! ...
Roman: 'Suuuuuup, y'all! It's time for me to help all y'all troubled teens with your traumas, like totally! It's Trouble Talk time! Lessee...

I want to study both battling and Pokémon research, and I can't pick just one!” Roman: Whoaaa... You are one hardworking kid! I know 'cause I hated to study anything! I really admire you, you know? Say... Professor Birch and the Petalburg Gym Leader, that new guy Norman, went to college together. If you could find a place like the one they went to, you could study both battling and Pokémon research! But it's crazy to ask me about something big like this! Talk to your guidance counselor! Good luck with your applications, and I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! See ya! ...
Roman: 'Suuuuuup, y'all! It's time for me to help all y'all troubled teens with your traumas, like totally! It's Trouble Talk time! Lessee... Today, we'll look at a letter from “I Love Roselia.” Yo, thanks for watching, I Love Roselia! Now whatta we got here... “I'm going on holiday in Hoenn next month with some friends of mine! Please recommend a city where we can really experience nature to the max!” Roman: Ooooh! Thanks for thinking of Hoenn. We'd love to see you! Check out somewhere like Fortree! Staying in their tree houses feels like camping! Oh, and maybe a tour with Winona, where she takes you to observe the wild bird Pokémon in the area! Winona can tell you everything about 'em, so you'll really learn a lot! Have a great trip, and we look forward to hosting you in Hoenn! See ya! ...
Roman: 'Suuuuuup, y'all! It's time for me to help all y'all troubled teens with your traumas, like totally! It's Trouble Talk time! Lessee...

We fight all the time, but I'm always the one who gets in trouble from our mom. What can I do?” Roman: Whoa-ho-ho! Siblings fighting, huh? Yeah, it happens. I've got a little brother, too, so I know eeeee-zackly what you mean, friend! How about this? You know the Gym Leaders in Mossdeep, Liza and Tate? Fact is, those two are complete opposites when it comes to personality and tastes and whatnot! Tate is a calm kid and loves to eat sweets, while rambunctious Liza loves spicy food! That's just how they are! But they each rely on the other's strengths to the fullest in Double Battles! Spending time with someone who likes different stuff than you is a chance to experience more and have a richer life! Sorry for dropping philosophy on you, but together, you can both grow more! See ya! ...
Roman: 'Suuuuuup, y'all! It's time for me to help all y'all troubled teens with your traumas, like totally! It's Trouble Talk time! Lessee... Today's letter comes from “Rainbow Soda.” Yo, thanks for watching, Rainbow Soda! Now whatta we got here... “I want to ask out a girl I like, but where's a good place for a date?” Roman: Smoooooth! Young love, huh? I've got it! The hottest date spot these days has gotta be Sootopolis City! Rumor has it that any couple who watches the water illusion show that Wallace puts on with his Luvdisc will be together forever! Strictly a rumor, of course. Wallace only does those shows when he feels like it, so there's no guarantee you and your would-be sweetie can catch one... Guess you'll have to trust to luck! I've got my fingers crossed for you! See ya next time! ...

Got that out of our systems! Hey, how about going to the ocean? Narrator: Timburr calmly accepts the invitation. Paul: C'mon! Face the ocean and shout! The answer you're looking for is there! Narrator: The two of them shout at the sea to their hearts' content. By fighting with Paul and yelling at the sea, Timburr was able to get rid of its pent-up frustrations. Now it understands how to deal with its anger and doesn't go wild anymore. Paul: Trainers! Enjoy the excitement of youth with your Pokémon! See you! ...

But then, the lovelorn Stunfisk takes him by surprise! Paul: Wait! You're going over there to talk? What will you say?! Stunfisk: Un! Un! Narrator: Stunfisk professes its affection again...and is rejected once more! Stunfisk: Uuuuunnn! Narrator: But in the process, Stunfisk made a decision and acted on it without fear of being hurt.

Narrator: On “The Pokémon Whisperer,” Pokémon with many different problems are brought to Pokémon Breeder Paul, who works to build a good relationship. Today's problem Pokémon is a runaway Audino! Since it can tell how people feel, it can also detect bad things, and it no longer trusts people. Wanting to teach it that people aren't all that bad, Paul sets off in search of Audino! Paul: Audino! Where are you? Narrator: Paul searches deserts, cities, even the depths of the ocean, but is unable to find it... Paul: Oh! What's that?

Narrator: On this episode of “The Pokémon Whisperer,” the story of What Audino Wants continues! Paul finally finds the runaway Audino and tries to talk to it... Paul: I know you can sense negative things about people, and that's what scared you away! But there are so many good things about people, too! Please give us another chance! Narrator: Startled by Paul's shouting, Audino runs away again! That's right! Because Audino have such good hearing, they dislike loud noises... and Paul has a hard time talking quietly! Paul: Guess that was a bad idea, huh... Narrator: Paul's usual way of doing things won't work this time! How will he communicate his feelings to Audino? Watch next week for the conclusion to What Audino Wants, and find out how Paul solves this dilemma! ...
Narrator: On this episode of “The Pokémon Whisperer,” it's the conclusion of What Audino Wants! A worried Paul searches once again for a runaway Audino, after scaring it away by shouting. Paul: This is so hard! How can I communicate to Audino without shouting? I want to tell it so many things! Narrator: After a long journey, he finds Audino in a cave deep in the mountains. With a great effort, he manages not to shout about his feelings. Instead, he runs up to Audino and gives it a big hug! Paul: Audino... Narrator: Audino can sense people's feelings. When it senses Paul's intense, sincere caring for Pokémon, its distrust of humans melts away... Paul: That's right! If you sincerely care about Pokémon, they will understand even if you don't use words! It's your feelings that are important! ...

They'll grow with the power of love! ...Probably! OK. See you next week! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I was just your average girl until I was struck by a Thunder Shock. It was love at first sight, baby! And my target, a Gym Leader! I didn't have any Pokémon then, but not a problem for a resourceful gal! The answer was simple—and we all know simple is best! I just had to become a Trainer. That's all it took for me! “The Diary of a Poké Romantic” will soon make its debut! The pilot episode: “Love at First Sight: The Rules of the Move Attract!” By the way, how did everyone get their first Pokémon anyway? ...
Best of Sinnoh TV After some fits and starts, a childhood friend gave me my first Pokémon! ...It was a Kricketot. Except...I don't like the legs of bugs. I bet he gave me this because I picked on him when he was little... But though the road has been long and hard, I'm finally at the starting line! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode two! “The Maiden in Love and the Kricketot: The Magic of Romance Never Ends!” Oh, this Kricketot is a female. Maybe we can be friends. ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I checked out my Kricketot and learned about its moves. ...It only knows Growl and Bide. That's worse than just challenging! I was about to say that, when my childhood friend stopped me. “Let it hold an Oran Berry so that it can survive while using Bide.” Hey, that's smart! That's from a former Bug Catcher! While we're at it, may I have an Oran Berry, too? Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode three! “Love Conquers All: Covering Weakness with Ideas!” We're a Trainer and Pokémon now! We'll get stronger together! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV I had my first ever Pokémon battle, and it ended badly... My childhood friend, a former Bug Catcher, had this to say... “Pokémon get tougher by battling. The key to victory is type matchups.” Type matchups? Types affect battles? The only type matchup I care about is with that Gym Leader! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode four! “Type Matchups Settle Battles! Moves That Exploit Weak Points!” Fire, Flying, and Rock... Kricketot has some disadvantages! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV We'd win a battle, and lose one. Lose one, then win one. Though it was at times discouraging, I had to keep battling to toughen us up. With me and Kricketot, it was always three steps forward, two steps back. But we were getting stronger. Then, one day, Kricketot started to shine! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode five! “Kricketot Becomes Kricketune! Watch Me! I'll Change, Too!” And to cancel Evolution, press the B Button... Tell me that first! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV After Kricketot evolved, it became stronger as Kricketune. We also got other Pokémon, so we could go farther and farther from home. But where is my beloved Gym Leader? Where is that city he said he's from? I do have the Town Map, but maps baffle me. It doesn't matter, though. If we keep moving, we'll get somewhere. Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode six! “How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms Can't Be Found Everywhere!” The more lost you are, the less useful a map becomes! You know it's true! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV Our journey was long, and it was hard. But no one wants to hear that! So, I finally found my Gym Leader. But he has an incurable disease! He begged me, out of the blue, with his last wish. He asked for my Pokémon! But my Kricketune's my partner! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode seven! “My Trail of Footprints Shortened the Distance Between Us!” Every time I see Kricketune's face, I am reminded of our time together... ...
Best of Sinnoh TV My beloved Gym Leader, whom I fought so hard to meet, was a fraud! How dare he con this pure maiden! How dare he toy with my emotions! But whose fault was it? Was it mine for being taken in? All I know is that my tears overflow, and despair is my world... Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” episode eight! “Kricketune and I! Our Bond Is True!” That Gym Leader's eating a Giga Impact for playing me for a fool! ...
Best of Sinnoh TV Having defeated the fake Gym Leader, Kricketune and I stood in a daze. We were spent. Drained by a romance that ended in a nightmare. It was then that my childhood friend, the former Bug Catcher, arrived. He did more than that. He confessed his love to me! “I wanted to become an Elite Four member, so I quit as a Gym Leader. But then that faker appeared. You took care of him, though!” Wait, ex-Bug Catcher! What? What are you saying?! Next week: “The Diary of a Poké Romantic,” final episode! “Do it, Kricketune! Silver Wind over Sinnoh Skies!” You were laughing at me for falling for that fraud, weren't you? ...

If you have Pokémon with you, then you're an official Pokémon Trainer! You can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost... I should have trained mine more...
Listen, you. If you're strong, you should have told me from the start!
Ever since I lost to you, I've trained my Pokémon like crazy. You can't say no to my challenge!
Arrgh, I lost... Is my training method not right?
If you're going to get stronger, I'll get stronger, too.
I got stronger, too, thanks to you! Take this as a sign of my gratitude!
Haha! Our eyes met! I'll take you on with my Bug Pokémon!
Ow! Down and out!
If you lock eyes with a Trainer, you have to challenge! It's a rule!
I caught a whole bunch of Pokémon! Go, go, go! My Bug Pokémon team!
I have all these Pokémon, but I couldn't win...
I caught a bunch of Pokémon. Now I'm out of Poké Balls.
I'm going to keep winning and aim to be the best Trainer. Help me further my career!
I ended up furthering your career...
To keep winning my way up, I see that I have to catch more Pokémon.
Did you feel the tug of our soul- soothing fragrance?
You weren't led astray by our aroma...
Aromatherapy can heal your mind and body.
I'm Amy, and this is my twin sister, Liv! We're gonna fight you together!
The two of us fight together as one!
Amy: We lost... Liv: We lost, Sis...
Taking on two opponents really makes you think!
My sister and I are the perfect team, but we still lost!
What?! You only have one Pokémon! You can't battle us like that!
If you want to battle us, you need two Pokémon! You'll be no match for us otherwise!
Gah! My fishing line's all snarled up! I'm getting frustrated! That's it! Battle me!
Gah! Lost it! I'm even more annoyed now!
Gah, I'm still boiling mad... Grrrrr...
Why keep it a secret? I'm the Water-Pokémon expert! Huh? You don't know me?
I thought I wasn't too bad, if I may say so, but I guess not... Bleah...
I got so into fishing that I forgot I had to raise my Pokémon...
If we were fishing, you wouldn't stand a chance against me. So, bring on your Pokémon!
If we were fishing, I would've won...
I think I'll try my luck at landing a big one at Meteor Falls. There has to be something in there. I just know it.
Leaving footprints in the sand is so fun!
Waah! I got sand in my runners! They're all gritty!
I want to leave my footprints in the sand everywhere, but they disappear quickly...
Should I... Or shouldn't I? OK, sure, I will battle!
Maybe I shouldn't have battled...
If you're faced with a decision and you let someone else choose for you, you will regret it—however things turn out.
Come on, battle with me!
Ohh... I thought I could win...
I made the decision to battle, so I can accept this loss in grace. I am still upset about losing, though!
I'm disappointed, but I have to thank you for that battle! Here, take this!
We learn all sorts of things at the Trainers' School. I want to test things out for real!
I slacked off in school... That's why I lost.
I'll have to redo some courses at the Trainers' School. If I don't, Roxanne will be steamed.
I've been studying seriously at the Trainers' School. I won't lose like I did last time.
Hunh? I studied diligently.
I'll have to redo some courses at the Trainers' School. If I don't, Roxanne will be steamed.
I'll give you this, so don't tell Roxanne that I lost, OK?
I study at school, and I study on the way home, too!
I'm in shock—I lost?
Awww, I'll never become an elegant Trainer like Roxanne this way!
I studied a whole lot since I saw you. You must see my achievements!
I'm in shock! I lost again?
Have you beaten Roxanne? Then I won't be able to beat you now.
I'm quite shocked, but also motivated. If you'd like, please use this.
[~ 77]
Y-you're crazy strong!
[~ 79]
Whoa! Stay away from me! Get away!
I was knocked out. Out like a light!
Huh? You aren't with that girl who uses Dragon types?! Oh man... I feel silly for being scared.
If you can't beat me, you won't stand a chance against Roxanne!
Wow! You've got some potential!
Roxanne is several times stronger than me. You'd better be on your guard!
My Pokémon and I rule! Check us out!
Ouch! A scrape! I have to put on a bandage!
Bandages are signs of toughness! I've got another one!
My Bug Pokémon are tough! Let's battle!
I lost! I thought I had you!
Bug Pokémon evolve quickly, so they get strong quickly, too.
Let me teach you how strong my adorable Pokémon is!
You're a notch above me...
Pokémon that possess cuteness and power, that's ideal, I think.
Whew! I was worried that a kid was drowning when I saw you. You seem to be OK, so what do you say to a battle?
Glub... Glub...
You're so strong for your age! How wonderful! When you get a little older, why don't you try being a lifeguard with me?
Swimming the deep blue sea... It's the greatest feeling!
I lost... Now I'm feeling blue...
Why is the sea blue? I learned about that at the museum in Slateport, but I totally forgot.
My body feels lighter in the water. It's like I've gotten slimmer!
I'm floating...
Your body weight is reduced to just one tenth in the water. That would make me... Whoops! I'm not telling you my weight!
The blue, blue sky... The vast sea... It's so peaceful...
I lost while I was lounging!
I want to be told I'm relaxing to be with. Giggle.
Hahaha! I'm a lousy runner, but in the water you can't catch me!
I give up!
I wouldn't lose in a swim race...
The sea is my backyard. I'm not going to take it easy because you're a kid!
Did you take it easy on me by any chance?
Drifting along with the waves... I love it! Why don't you give it a try?
Which do you prefer, fishing in the sea or a stream?
Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost spectacularly!
Fishing is the greatest, whether it's in the sea or in a stream. You agree with me, right?
I caught a bunch of Pokémon by fishing. I'll show you an impressive battle!
I lost spectacularly again!
Win or lose, Pokémon are the greatest! You agree with me, right?
Time for a lavish banquet!
What do people do if they need to go take a break? What if my rod hooks a big one while I'm in the washroom? I just can't leave...
I lost because I'm trying to not go to the washroom...
Oh, no! I've got this feeling I'll hook a big one!
My electric soul, it'll shatter your dreams whole, whoa-yeah!
That was plugged in, amped up, overdriven electric, man!
Pokémon and rock, it's all about heart, whoa yeah!
I trained under Wattson! There ain't no way I'd lose easily!
Unplugged and turned off...
Wattson, our Gym Leader, has been around for a long, long time. He was battling even before your daddy was born, that tough coot.
Yawn... I must have drifted off to sleep while I was drifting in the waves.
Ahaha, I lost... I'll take a snooze, I think...
Floating and being rocked by the waves— it's like sleeping in a plush, comfy bed.
The sea is like my backyard. Let's battle!
I lost on my home field... I'm in shock!
I swim the seas with a heart full of dreams... It's a song! Anyways, I'm gonna swim some more!
Swimming in the vast, deep sea, my Pokémon has grown a lot stronger!
What a shock! My Pokémon has gotten stronger, but I stayed weak as a Trainer!
What you learn in battle makes you a stronger Trainer. The waves taught me that.
I lost, so I guess I have no choice! I'll go ahead and give this to you!
Do you know a little town called Dewford?
I hate this!
A weird saying is getting really trendy at Dewford Hall.
Did you want to battle me? Sure, I'll go up against you!
I was no match for you.
I think you're going to keep getting better. I'll go for it, too!
My dream is to swim the world's seven seas!
I won't be able to swim the seven seas like this...
Playing with marine Pokémon is one of the pleasures of swimming!
Ahoy, there! Are you going out to Sea Mauville, too?
I might not make it...
Sea Mauville is like a hidden tourist spot around here.
My liar of a boyfriend told me that I look great in a bikini...
Oh, boo!
Even if it's a lie, I love being told I look great... We girls are so complex...
I love the sea! I forget all my worries when I swim!
When I lose a battle, I get all stressed out!
Work off your stress by swimming! It's so healthy!
Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs! This is what you call “cut”!
Aiyah! Flubbed out!
Hiyah! My sculpted abs have nothing to do with Pokémon battles!
Are you properly protected against the sun?
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My cheeks are the most prone to burning!
I've laid anchor in ports around the world, but Slateport's the best.
You're the best!
In the best port was the best Trainer...
Urrrrppp... Battle? With me?
Urp... Ooooooohhhhhh... Urrrrpppp...
I'm usually stronger than this! I'm just seasick as a dog! I am a Sailor, though...
Doesn't a beach umbrella look like a giant flower?
Mommy!
If you look at the beach from the sky, it looks like a big flower garden!
I'm not losing to you again! That's why I have my inner tube!
Mommy!
When I have an inner tube, me and my Pokémon's cuteness goes way up!
I won't give you my tube, but I'll give you this!
Whoa! Watch it! I guess you're not used to Bike racing.
Whoa! My brakes failed!
Flat tires and brake problems can cause serious injury! Inspect your Bike for problems!
Yo, you! Can you keep up with my speed?
Crash and burn!
Speed alone won't let me win Pokémon battles. I need to reconsider this...

Could I see your Pokémon? Just one look, please?
I wanted to complete my collection.
When I see a Pokémon that I don't know, my passion as a collector is ignited!
Hi, have you caught any new Pokémon? Could I see your Pokémon? Just one look, please?
Your Pokémon... I envy you.
I long to make all rare Pokémon mine!
I lost, so it can't be helped. I'll give you this from my collection that I'm so proud of.
Hey! Don't sneak up behind me when I'm fishing!
I lost! Drat!
Fishing is all about concentration. You have to focus on the bobber.
I'm Amy! This is my sister, Liv! We battle together!
The two of us fight together as one!
Amy: I'm disappointed... We weren't able to win... Liv: We lost again, Sis...
Taking on two opponents really makes you think!
My sister and I are the perfect team... How could we lose again?
What?! You have only one Pokémon! You can't battle us like that!
If you want to battle us, you need two Pokémon! You'll be no match for us otherwise!
Might is right! Come on!
Not enough power...
Your skill overcame my strength! Your technique is commendable!
You're a Pokémon Trainer. No need for words. We battle now.
...
It was I who challenged you, and yet I lost. I am deeply shamed...
I contemplate Pokémon 24 hours a day. How could you possibly beat me?
I lose. I will concede defeat.
Urggh... You're a Pokémon fanatic, aren't you? You must contemplate Pokémon 24 hours a day, right?
There's no need for Brawly to be involved! I'll crush you!
But... How? How could I lose so easily?
I'm not going to waste this loss. I'll use it to motivate me to train! One day, I'll become a Gym Leader... No, I'll become the Pokémon League Champion!
Don't you dare brush me off! It's not my fault if you cry!
Waaaaaaah! I lost!
A long time ago at Dewford Gym, it was always dark inside. We trained our minds by practicing in the dark!

[~ 235]
[~ 236]
I couldn't restore HP enough... What Attack power...
[~ 238]
[~ 239]
Your power... You're the real deal.
[~ 241]
[~ 242]
You were a cut above me...
[~ 244]
[~ 245]
Our defenses weren't enough...
[~ 247]

My passionate love for my Bike has brought me here!
Your Bike is lovely, too...
I absolutely love my Bike, but I'm not coordinated enough to ride it... I can't ride, so I'm just sneakily watching all the people riding their Bikes.
I've finally made it to Mt. Chimney. I want to make my Pokémon battle!
The way you battle... It's just like a Mt. Chimney eruption!
Like I said, I've finally made it to Mt. Chimney. It would be a shame if I only do a little sightseeing... I want to get in some battles and buy Lava Cookies as souvenirs.
[~ 269]
Huh? Did I really lose?
[~ 271]
Hahahaha! How about we have a battle? You and me! Hahahaha!
I lost! Hahahaha!
This isn't fun at all, but for some reason  I c-can't stop laughing! Hahahaha!
My legs are solid from pounding up and down the mountains. They're not going to buckle easily, friend!
Ouch! My legs cramped up!
Try hiking, and I mean really pounding, on these mountain trails with a heavy pack weighing dozens of pounds. That, my friend, will get your body in serious shape.
I've been keeping fit by hiking. Power, I have in spades!
I got trumped in power?
I hear there are some seriously tough Trainers on top of Mt. Chimney. I intend to get up there and give them a challenge!
All right, take this. Hikers have big enough hearts to praise the winner.
I'm strong. I won't cry if I lose.
Waaaah!
I'm not crying because I miss my mommy! Sniffle...
When you're out on a picnic, why, you simply have to sing! Come on, sing with me!
Oh, you're so strong!
It doesn't matter if you're good or bad at singing or Pokémon battles. If you have the most fun, you win!
Owowowowow! Yikes, it's hot!
I'm blinded by sweat in my eyes...
A hot bath promotes circulation. It's effective for healing pain in your joints.
[~ 291]
[~ 292]
[~ 293]
I'm trying to relieve my stress. Don't come along and stress me out!
I hope Flannery burns you good!
Haaah... Whew... If you spend too much time in the bath, it tuckers you out...
[~ 297]
[~ 298]
[~ 299]
You must be getting tired by now. You'd like to rest in a hot bath, eh? But you should know that maintaining your willpower is an important ability for all Trainers.
Play with fire, get burned...
Your skill is real... But our Leader Flannery is strong. If you don't watch yourself, she'll burn you up!
Can you guess why it's so cool around here?
Peeuuw! That stinks!
The volcanic ash blocks the sun, so it doesn't get very warm. That's good for me—I can't stand heat!
The volcano's eruption is proof that the world is alive.
You're some kind of strong!
Ouch! Owww! I can't see! I got ashes in my eyelashes! Get it? Ashes rhymes with lashes? OK, that was bad, sorry...
[~ 309]

I'll make sure you've been raising your Pokémon right.
Yes, you're raising your Pokémon right.
If you feed Pokéblocks to Pokémon, the unique aspects of their character will be enhanced.
I'll make sure you're still raising your Pokémon right.
You're raising your Pokémon wonderfully.
Pokémon seem to like different kinds of Pokéblocks, depending on their nature.
For you, who has raised your Pokémon so well!
Yo-de-lay-i-hoo! ... You have to shout “yo-de-lay-i-hoo,” too, since it doesn't echo here!
Yo-de-lay-i-hoo!
When I was a wee tyke, I believed there was someone copying me and shouting back, “Yo-de-lay-i-hoo!”
If you're not prepared, you shouldn't be up in the mountains!
The mountains are unforgiving...
In the winter, mountains turn deadly with blizzards and avalanches.
Camping's fun! You can fish, roast marshmallows, and tell spooky stories! But the best of all are the Pokémon battles!
Way too strong!
I'm happy enough just going camping with my Pokémon.
I need to exercise after a meal. Let's have a match!
Oh, no!
I just had a tasty meal. I'm getting drowsy...
Ufufufufufu... Want to battle against my Pokémon?
M-my Pokémon...
A big body that's all lumpy and hard, enormous horns, and vicious fangs... Ufufufufu... I wish I had a Pokémon like that...
Ufufufufufu... Come on, battle my Pokémon...
I feel so lucky getting to see your Pokémon...
Ufufufufufu... When I see Pokémon battling, I get all shivery and shaky...
Ufufufufufu... You want this? You want this, right?
Hmm... You seem rather capable. Let me keep you company!
You're much stronger than I imagined!
There is no such thing as a born genius. It all depends on effort! That is what I believe...
Hmm... As always, your agility speaks for itself. Come, keep me company!
As strong as ever!
All it takes is effort! I lost because I haven't put in enough effort!
I, the defeated, shall send you, the victor, this.
My! Machop! Demand a battle!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
My Machop crew! So long as they seek power, I will grow strong with them!
My strongest skill is busting bricks with my forehead!
Ugwaaaah! My head is busted!
I've been teaching my Pokémon karate. Looks like it will be a lot better than I am! That's exciting!
After you beat me, we trained hard to improve our skills. Come on, give us a rematch!
Ugwaaah! We lost again!
My Pokémon will grow stronger! I'll redouble my training!
I-I have no choice! I'll give you this fair and square!
This beach is my secret training spot! Don't come butting in!
I haven't trained enough!
The sand acts as a cushion to reduce impact and prevent injury. This is the perfect place to train.
OK, let's get this battle going!
I can battle, but my Pokémon...
Even when I lose, I still get some enjoyment out of it. It must be that I love Pokémon.
Gracias for the bueno battle! Here you go! This is my way of saying gracias!
I have a rare Pokémon! Would you like me to show you?
You... You want my Pokémon, don't you?
I have this rare Pokémon. It's enough to keep me satisfied.
The aroma of flowers has a magical power. It cleanses us, body and soul.
Oh, dear me. I seem to have lost.
Flowers, Pokémon... I love whatever smells nice. Stinky things... I'll pass.
Were you drawn here by the sweet aroma?
The power of aroma... It didn't seem to do much.
If you use Sweet Scent properly, Pokémon will be attracted by it.
Ufufu... Will you check whether this present from me is sweet or not?
Bird Pokémon that Fly elegantly in the sky... They're the best!
Urgh... I crashed...
You've got great Pokémon. I'll have to train mine better.
We're the Mimic Circle! We Mimic what you do!
Whoopsie! I lost!
What's so good about mimicry? Fufufu... You'll never understand...
So, we finally meet! My Bug Pokémon will keep you company!
I wish we'd never met...
I want to Mimic you some more. Can you hurry up and move?
If you step forward, we step forward. If you turn right, we turn, too...
But if you win, I lose...
I can't Mimic you winning the match. That's just impossible... It's burning me up...
Yep, you've finally caught me! Or were you trying to avoid me?
Whoop, that was a great match!
We're the Mimic Circle! I hope you enjoyed our performance.
You don't know who I am, do you? Well... I don't know you, either. Let's just battle anyway!
You're pretty strong, aren't you?!
Until you go away somewhere, we'll keep on mimicking your every move.
The Mimic Circle was formed by people who like to Mimic. A battle starts the instant we meet!
I surrender!
Won't you join our Mimic Circle?
Who has the knowledge and the technique for survival? Pokémon Rangers, that's who!
I didn't have enough Pokémon know-how...
To break away from civilization and awaken the wild spirit within! That's our vision.
I'm going to regain my wild spirit by being together with Pokémon.
You're still strong!
Believe in your Pokémon. Believe in yourself. The road will reveal itself to you.
Can you take back your wildness by using this? That depends on how motivated you are!
Oh? Look at you. For someone on an adventure, you're traveling awfully light.
Accidents happen when you're not prepared!
You're traveling light but have everything you need. You're on top of things mentally and physically, too.
How's your journey with Pokémon going?
I'm still missing something...
In the same way that you, as a Trainer, rely on your Pokémon, your Pokémon rely on you.
I hope you find this useful on your adventure with your Pokémon...
The vast sky holds untold promise! Nothing can compare to the sheer exhilaration of flight!
Down and out!
My bird Pokémon made my dreams of flying come true!
I'll show you the true potential of my bird Pokémon!
We lacked potential...
Ever since I was a little kid, I always admired bird Pokémon...
To lurk in shadows, and live in darkness... That is my destiny. I emerge to challenge you!
I admit defeat!
Those defeated in battle withdraw quietly back into the shadows. That, too, is destiny...
If you're not on your guard, you're in for some pain!
You're surprisingly good!
My surprise attack ended in failure...
Behold the elegant battle style of bird Pokémon!
You... You're strong...
A Trainer has to be smart to keep up with unexpected turns of events. Let's see if you have the smarts to get to our Leader.

The lovers of bird Pokémon aspire to join this Gym. As a member of the Fortree Gym, I'm not allowed to lose!
It was too much of a load for me to bear...
The world is huge, and there are countless tough Trainers. I'm going to keep training and make myself even stronger.
Do you have any moves that can strike a flying Pokémon?
You soared above me!
The move Fly is convenient, don't you think? While the Pokémon is flying, almost no moves can strike it.
My Pokémon is strong! How about your Pokémon?
You and your Pokémon were stronger...
A Pokémon that grows steadily is one you can count on.
A Pokémon that grows steadily is one you can count on.
You and your Pokémon are seriously strong.
My Pokémon is growing stronger. I have to grow stronger, too.
I want to go on an adventure like you someday! Please take this as a sign of my respect.

I'll check your Pokémon and see if they're fit for the outdoors.
With Pokémon that strong, you're in no danger of needing rescue!
To travel wherever your heart desires with Pokémon... That's the joy of being a Trainer.
How's your physical fitness? If you're not fit, you could have a rough time in critical situations.
I'm totally fit, but...
Fitness training is in my routine. I always run with my Pokémon.
... Wanna battle?
... I lost.
... I'll try harder.
... Wanna battle again?
... I lost again.
... I'll try harder...for my precious Bug Pokémon.
... Take it...
Hey, could I get you to battle the Pokémon I'm raising?
You've raised yours superbly...
Training Pokémon isn't all about power. Improving a unique aspect of their character is another way of enjoying Pokémon.
The Pokémon I've been raising are looking good, just like before.
You know how to raise Pokémon... You might have Day Care skills.
You're raising your Pokémon so well! Maybe you and your Pokémon should enter the Contest Spectacular.
I wonder if this will help you train Pokémon...

This is where we Dragon Tamers do our training. The Champion even visits. Now do you see how special it is here?
Urgh! I didn't expect you to be so strong!
The road ahead remains long and harsh. When will my Pokémon and I become the best?
Since we met, we have trained hard with our sights on number one. Help us see how much stronger we've become!
Urgh! I didn't expect you to be so strong!
You've obviously kept up your Pokémon training. So long as you remain strong, I, too, can become stronger!
I give this to you, whose power has surpassed that of Dragon types.
Hey, are you lost at sea? If you can beat my Pokémon, I can guide you through the currents.
I lost my bearings in battle!
Many people lose their bearings at sea. If you're that sort, you should check your location on your AreaNav as you go.
Hmmph! You're riding a Pokémon instead of swimming yourself... I'm so jealous!
Oh! It's no use...
I'm getting chilly... I've been in the water too long... I wish I could ride a Pokémon like you...
I heard you approaching, so I hung around waiting for you!
Have mercy!
Sound travels faster in water than it does through air.
Hey, there! Check out my sweet Pokémon!
I floundered...
I was blown away by Horsea's charm, so I started swimming, too.
Swimming is a full-body workout! You will get fit!
I admit it! You win!
Thanks to my daily swimming routine... Look! Feast your eyes on this physique!
This towering white mountain of rock is Sootopolis City.
Have I been beaten?!
I can't find the entrance to Sootopolis. Where could it be?
What a surprise! I didn't expect to see a Trainer out in the sea. I think we should battle!
This kid's awfully tough...
Your eyes have that look of someone who's experienced harsh challenges and won. It suits you well!
The sea is teeming with Pokémon. It's not easy swimming, I tell you.
Pokémon raised by Trainers are seriously tough...
Gasp... Gasp... I'm wiped out... Going's easy. Coming back is the hard part. Will I have the energy left to make it back?
The sea... The sea... The sea... The sea as far as these eyes can see! I'm sick and tired of the sea!
Bleah!
Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must. I'm a born swimmer! That's what I am.
I used to catch colds all the time as a kid, but I became totally fit after I started swimming.
I wanna get stronger...
Trainers travel the fields and mountains, so they must be fit, too.
Did the currents carry you here, too? This must have been fated. Let's battle!
Strong! Too much so!
It's just my luck that a tough Trainer like you would drift here... I must be cursed...
Even Pokémon that can swim get swept away by these currents!
Aiyeeeeh!
It looks like Pokémon enjoy these fast currents!

If you just float in the sea like this, Pokémon come around to play!
Oh... Lost at sea...
While swimming, I noticed that some Pokémon attack, and some just watch. I guess Pokémon have personalities of their own.
If you just float in the sea like this, Trainers challenge you!
That's strange... I lost again...
This has nothing to do with anything, but maybe I'll visit the Trick House.
Darn! Go on and take this from me!
I'm getting tired of swimming... How about a battle?
I had no idea that you were this strong!
All the effort you put in must have made you this strong.
I'm tired from swimming. Are you up for a battle with me?
You're too much!
Whew... Which way is it to Mossdeep City?
How would you like to take on the Water-type Pokémon I raised?
I lost...
Your power... You're the real deal. I'm amazed!
Ufufufufu! I'm a mermaid!
My fantasy burst as if it were a bubble! Blub, blub, blub...
You thrashed me... I want to disappear in a wave of despair...
Hello, kiddo! Want a battle with me?
Oh, nooooo!
I love frolicking with Pokémon in the sea like this!
In the deep blue sea, my shattered blue heart finds comfort among waves.
Like the vast blue sea, the world of Pokémon spans depths beyond belief.
The world's children dream of one day becoming the Pokémon Champion.
Hi, sweetie, wait! We should battle, you and me!
You're tough in spite of the way you look!
Did you see a guy over there who whines that he's bored of the sea? That's all talk. He's hopelessly in love with the sea!
Why do guys make such a big deal about swimsuits? They're always staring!
I'm out of my depth!
Maybe it's not my swimsuit they're looking at. Maybe I'm just that beautiful!
I try not to swim where the currents are too strong.
Oh no!
If I get swept away, I'll lose all my sense of place...
I've led a life of woe and misery... I've been cast away, and this is where I've drifted...
Another loss...
A life adrift... I don't want it anymore!
Welcome! I've been expecting you!
No! Please!
A strong child Trainer... That's so annoying!
Even those Pokémon that can swim are carried along by the rapid currents.
Aiyeeeeh!
I think Pokémon enjoy the fast-running currents around these parts.
My Luvdisc are looking for a fun match. Will you join us?
Oopsie!
There's a collector who's after the scales of Luvdisc.
Battles hinge on the strength of your spirit! The weak-spirited will never win!
I lost! I must temper my spirit again!
The indecisive lose. That's my warning to you.
Let me see your talent!
You possess spectacular talent!
If there are prodigies in the world, then that's what our Gym Leaders are! However, you may be even more talented than they are...
Fufufufu... Watch me levitate a Poké Ball telekinetically! Wrooooooooaaaar! ... Sometimes, I'm out of sync...
My Pokémon battling skills are out of sync, too!
A Poké Ball was too heavy to lift, but this dust bunny... Whoooooooooooooooh! ... No, I'm not cheating! I didn't blow on it! Honest!
When you lose to me, don't be too hard on yourself. It's not that you're weak—I'm just too strong!
You're just too strong!
I'm not going to get down on myself for losing. I just need to train harder. Positive thinking—that's my strong point!
I see it... I see your future... If you can beat me, I will tell you your future!
I surrender!
You will wage a terrifically intense battle with our Gym Leaders... The result... You won't hear it from me!
The roads you have traveled... What you have experienced... Come at me with everything you've learned!
You've traveled a path of greatness!
A bright future awaits those who have worked diligently. For those who lazed idly, there is only despair at the end. What goes around comes around...
I can see it in your face. You want to challenge me.
Awawawawawa...
A well-played match leaves me feeling refreshed and serene.

Ever Grande City is still a long ways away...
My first victory seems to be far away, too...
My whole life has been about losing, but I will never give up!
I'm still feeling good. I'll keep on swimming to Ever Grande City.
I've yet to taste my first victory...
If I don't give up, I'll win someday and make it to Ever Grande City, too.
Maybe you can use this to prepare for your trip to Ever Grande City...
[~ 596]

This is my first triathlon. I'm all tense and nervous!
Wroooaaar! I failed to win!
If I'm all tensed up, I won't be able to give it my all.

Like I figured...
[~ 628]
Ayiyiyi! Suspicious character spotted!
Grrrrr... I lost it!
I may have lost the battle, but I've fulfilled my duty...
You have to defeat me if you want to learn the secret of our hideout!
I never had a chance!
The secret of our hideout? We have a submarine all the way in the back! But by this time, tee-hee...
Fuel supply: check! Snack supply: check! All that's left is to get rid of everyone who stands in our way!
I took a serious licking!
Hmmph! That was enough. My mission was just to slow you down.
Ahaha! You really kept me waiting! How about a battle with me?
I was waiting for so long only to be defeated...
Boss... Is this good enough?
[~ 641]
Uwah!
[~ 643]
[~ 644]
The hurdles are too high for me out here on land!
[~ 646]
I have no time for children. Run along home now!
I wanna go home!
I want to be an Admin so I can make my Grunts do all the work!
The submarine is small so it makes you sore all over, doesn't it?
Losing makes me sore, too!
That submarine we jacked, man, it's brutal as a ride. It's way too tight in there!
Who are you? How did you get in here?
Lost it...
I can't find the way out! I'm not afraid. Don't get me wrong!
[~ 656]
[~ 657]
[~ 658]
The rich atmosphere of the mountain has elevated my psychic power! A mere child like you... You dream of winning?
I drown in self-pity...
My psychic powers have surely grown several times, but...
[~ 662]
[~ 663]
[~ 664]
Hey! Are you searching for Pokémon? You came along after me! How rude!
Ayieeeeh! I'm sorry, forgive me, please!
People don't come here often, so I thought there'd be rare Pokémon.
[~ 668]
[~ 669]
[~ 670]
Fufufufu... I dive deep underwater to go deep under cover. Plumbing the depths is where I excel!
You can't dive deep!
I have it on good authority that there's a Dive spot around here. It gives me the urge to go deep again...
Ahoy! I'm a buff, tough Sailor! I've braved the world's seas!
Gwrroooar! I couldn't win!
The tide ebbs and flows inside the Shoal Cave. By the way, it's about six hours from high tide to low tide. Did you know that?
It's high time I get my payback from you! Come on, we're battling!
I couldn't win! I flat out couldn't win!
The Shoal Cave... There are places you can and can't get to depending on the rise and fall of the tide. By the way, it's about six hours from high tide to low tide. Don't forget!
Feel free to take this as a gift from me to you.

That girl may have totally destroyed me earlier, but it can't go that way all the time!
Am I doomed to repeat my mistakes? Does this mean I'll lose my next battle, too?!
Now that I've gotten a good look at you, you're that kid from the other day, right? Please, you've got to help Archie and Shelly! The way that girl handled her Pokémon... She may actually be better than Shelly or even Archie himself!
Do you think I'm just gonna stand around while everybody pushes past me? Humph!
What! Are you gonna be someone else who pushes right on past me?
That Whismur that broke through here earlier was terrifying. The lady with it was awesome, too, but the Whismur scared the pants off me.
If you're on the lookout for a battle at the Seashore House, you'll find no hotter Trainer than me, matey!
That certainly was a hot battle! I can accept that loss, matey!
Whenever I'm in Slateport, I enjoy hot battles and ice-cold Soda Pop!
I'm going to show you how great my Pokémon are, but don't cry!
I lost, but I won't cry...
If one of my Pokémon knew the move for carrying me across water on its back, I could get rid of this inner tube.
I wandered into this weird house by accident...
And now I've lost...
I lost my way, I lost a battle, and I'm even more lost... I can't get out...
I'll hack and slash my way to victory with the Cut we just learned!
Why are you so serious?
I never get tired of hacking and slashing!
Just who is the Trick Master?
I lost while I was lost in thought!
You're strong! Just who are you?
It's too much bother to think this out. I only wanted to battle!
Even though I lost, I still like battling the best!
Don't you think? Wouldn't you go anywhere if you knew there would be Trainers there?
[~ 738]
[~ 739]
[~ 740]
It's dark—so dark... Even though we're inside...
It's far too dark and scary for me to battle...
What do they mean by “Trick House”? This is just another haunted house...
[~ 744]
[~ 745]
[~ 746]
I want to make my own Gym one day. So I'm studying how to set traps here.
I didn't study battling enough!
You're strong, aren't you? Maybe even strong enough to be a Gym Leader!
[~ 750]
[~ 751]
[~ 752]
I'm looking to see if I can't find a Secret Spot around here...
I shouldn't have battled...
Wait a minute, are you looking for Secret Spots, too? That makes us rivals, then, doesn't it?!
[~ 756]
[~ 757]
[~ 758]
Heh! Boulders like the ones in this room, I can brush aside with one finger!
I can crush boulders, but I can't find my way...
It's not good enough to be brawny when you don't have enough brains. Be brainy!
Ugh! How long must this crushing go on? My Pokémon and I are getting worn out by it...
I'm worn out... I'm all worn out now...
You and your Pokémon don't seem to be affected at all. Or do you have your poker face on?
When I heard there was a strange house, I had to check it out.
I've discovered a tough Trainer!
I'm checking this place out, but it's really difficult, so I've had to repeat the challenge many times!
[~ 768]
[~ 769]
[~ 770]
I'm getting an ominous feeling about you...
I knew I would lose... You're a bad omen!
I wonder if Liza and Tate are OK...
I can't get enough of the way you go floating up softly in this Gym.
Oops, I gave you a soft match, too.
Are the traps here some kind of superpower? Or is this the latest technology?
[~ 777]
[~ 778]
[~ 779]
It's not like I'm stranded or anything. This is just what I do for training.
I can't take it anymore... I'm too hungry to go on...
I'm pretending like I really did get lost to train for when I'm really in a survival situation.

We of Team Aqua are working hard for everyone's sake. Like, if there's more water around, Water Pokémon will be happy, and it'll give people more fun places to swim!
Hunh? What do you mean I lost?
Our Boss says, “It will make everyone happy.” But why does everyone keep getting in our way?
What's this?! What's this?! Another intruder in our hideout?!
Uhhnn... I guess we're open to the public...
Huh?! You aren't an intruder? So you're not with that girl and her Whismur?
[~ 801]
You've really done it, child. You've shown a power that exceeds that of the great Maxie!
[~ 803]
[~ 804]
Ugh! You are...quite capable... I fell behind, but only by an inch...
[~ 806]
Hahaha! Suspicious person spotted!
Wh-what?! I lost!
I may have lost the battle, but I have fulfilled my purpose...
If you want to know the secrets of our hideout, try to defeat me!
I have no chance of winning...
The secrets of our hideout? Well... All the way in the back we have a submarine! Tee hee! But by now...
Energy supply: OK! Snack supply: OK! All that's left is to take out anyone who stands in our way!
I've been harshly defeated!
Hmmph! Fine then! My mission was just to hold you up.
Wahaha! I grow weary of waiting! I shall have you give me a battle!
I grew weary of waiting and then lost... I've been defeated...
Leader... Please forgive me...
[~ 819]
I'm speechless!
[~ 821]
I have no use for children! G'wan, get outta here!
I want to go home!
In the end, I was just an opponent for a kid in a Pokémon battle...
The submarine is so small and cramped that it makes your body hurt, but I don't mind it.
It hurts when you lose! I don't mind that, either, though.
Riding in the submarine we stole is the best. It's just wonderful that it's so cramped.
Who are you? How did you get in here?
That was a total and complete loss...
I don't know where the exit is! I'm not scared, though! Don't get me wrong!
[~ 831]
[~ 832]
[~ 833]
[~ 834]
[~ 835]
[~ 836]
[~ 837]
You're so strong!
[~ 839]
Whoa! Don't come near! Back! Get back!
I was knocked out. Out like a light!
Huh? You aren't with that girl who uses Dragon types? How about that... It was silly of me to be so scared, then.
I slipped up and let that girl defeat me earlier, but it won't go that way all the time!
Time and time again... I'm a man who can't do his job...
Now that I get a good look at you, aren't you that kid from the other day? Listen, our Leader and Tabitha are in danger. The way that girl handled her Pokémon earlier... She might even be better than Tabitha—no, than Leader Maxie himself!
I can't stand everybody just pushing right past me!
It's laughable! The way everybody pushes their way right past me is...laughable.
That Whismur earlier pushed past me with tremendous power... The girl that ran through here with it was amazing, too... But, to be honest, the Whismur was the scarier one.
[~ 849]
Hyuhn?!
[~ 851]
We of Team Magma are working hard for everyone's sake. Like, if there's more land, there'd be more places to live. Everyone would be happy!
Hunh? What do you mean I lost?
Our Boss says, “It will make everyone happy.” But why does everyone keep getting in our way?
Hey, intruder person! You know the rule! When our eyes meet, we gotta have a Pokémon battle!
Guess you're not the kind of opponent that it's OK for me to lock eyes with...
Since we transformed our organization, we haven't had even one intruder. Could this be the work of Team Aqua? Why this? Why now?
[~ 858]
Ugh! Uhhn ugh! Is this the end of my evil deeds?!
[~ 860]
[~ 861]
Ugh! Uhhn ugh! Is this the end of my evil deeds?!

The Boss got interested in the research they have going here, so he sent us out. Quit your meddling!
Blast it... Blasted by a kid...
Our Boss knows everything. But I'm just a Grunt. What would I know about what he's thinking? I wonder if Shelly can tell how clueless I am...
I came here because I heard that the Institute is investigating the relationship between super-ancient Pokémon and the weather!
Our plan's being spoiled by a kid?
The overwhelming power of a super-ancient Pokémon to even control the weather freely...! We, Team Aqua, definitely need it!
We're Team Aqua! We appear wherever anything rare is found!
You got me!
You don't have any idea what we of Team Aqua are working toward! You stay out of our way!
Huh? What's a kid doing here?
Huh? I lost?!
Oh, no... I'll catch an earful for losing to a kid... I should just take a nap in the bed...

I like to fish. But I also like to battle! If anyone challenges me, I'm there, even if I'm fishing.
I like to battle, but that doesn't mean I'm good at it...
This time I'll do it! I always think that, so I can't walk away from fishing or Pokémon.
If the tunnel doesn't go through, then I'll just go over the top.
Gasp... Gasp... Losing made me tired...
It's no big deal if there's no tunnel. To a Hiker, mountains are roads!
Don't panic if your Bike's going fast!
I shouldn't panic during Pokémon battles...
There's no need to panic or stress. Take it easy. There's plenty of time.
Aren't you going a little too fast? Take it easy and let's battle.
I didn't panic, but I still lost...
There's no need to panic or stress. Take it easy. There's plenty of time.
Take your time. Take it slow. Well, just use this however you like.
All right! You're gonna battle our Pokémon!
We're twins, so we battle Pokémon together, too!
Gina: I'm so disappointed that we lost. Mia: We lost even though we fought together...
You're tough! We'll train more!
We'll train our Pokémon to get stronger like you!
Huh? You only have one Pokémon! We can't battle you! We feel sorry for your lonely Pokémon, since you only have one, after all.
Do you want to battle us? Then you're going to need to bring two Pokémon! We're tough, after all!
Please don't cry when your Pokémon lose!
All right! We're gonna take out your Pokémon!
Miu: We lost... Yuki: We lost...
You're close with your Pokémon. That's why they're strong!
How did you get so strong? That's the first time we lost a battle!
Battling without at least two Pokémon is boring!

Mt. Chimney's Jagged Pass... Now this is what I've always wanted in a mountain. This jagged bumpiness... It rocks my soul!
Losing left me bitter!
Yes, I did lose at Pokémon... But, when it comes to the love of the mountains, I have you beat!
Jagged Pass is hard to walk on. It's a good place for training.
It was all over while we were still trying to find our footing...
If I had an Acro Bike, I'd be able to jump ledges.
I got used to this bumpiness. I sing while I climb now.
It's still not easy to battle on this bumpy ground...
I should get an Acro Bike from Rydel in Mauville City...
Here you go. I carried this here across the uneven ground, wobbling all the way.
This place isn't your casual hike. It's not suited for a picnic.
Ohhh, no! The ground is too bumpy...
Did you know? Some people skillfully ride their Bikes up this horrible, bumpy pass.
Picnics are fun wherever you go. Just like Pokémon!
I only lost because the ground is too bumpy!
I'll forget about losing and just enjoy this bumpy hike.
I want to forget that I lost as soon as possible! Let me off with this!

I'll show you exactly how scary Team Aqua can be!
So you think you can pick a fight with Team Aqua all by your lonesome...
Yeah, so you are strong... But there're a lot of us!
What's up with you, brat? What does a single kid expect to do?
Wow, you're remarkably strong.
S-sorry! You don't know anything, though, so quit messing around with us!
Hey, I remember you from Mt. Chimney! It's payback time!
Urgggh... Beaten by some kid—again!
Heh, it doesn't matter! We bought ourselves some time! The Boss should have snatched what he was after!
I shall show you the true terror of Team Magma!
I see. Do you intend to defy Team Magma all by yourself?
You certainly are strong... But we are everywhere!
Who are you? What can a kid do all by themself?
Hruh. I'll feel that one later...
I-I surrender! But how dare you get in our way when you know nothing of our plans?!
You... We met at Mt. Chimney! Now I'll take my revenge!
Uhhn... I lost to a kid again.
That's all right. I was able to buy some time. We should have already stolen what the leader sent us here for!

Did you just become a Trainer? We're both beginners!
I challenged you because I thought I could beat you...
I haven't won once yet... I hope I win soon...
If you take Bug Pokémon to school, you get to be instantly popular!
I can't be popular if I lose.
If you have a big Bug Pokémon, people respect you for it.
Check the growth of my Bug Pokémon! I'll be popular again!
I can't be popular if I lose.
You get to be popular if you have strong Pokémon, right? That's why I've been training hard!
If I can become more popular, I'll gladly present you with this!

I found some cool Pokémon in the tall grass around here!
Being cool isn't enough to win...
It's hard to battle with Pokémon you just caught.
Once a Bug Catcher! And now a Bug Maniac! But my love for Pokémon remains unchanged!
My ineptitude also remains unchanged...
All I did was follow my heart, and now they call me a Bug Maniac... Still, I am an expert on Bug Pokémon, so it's only natural that they call me a Bug Maniac.
What do you call a man who lives among the mountain crags? A mountain man, right? So why don't they call a Pokémon that climbs steep cliffs a Pocragmon?
My Pokémon... Ran out of power...
They halted development here to protect Pokémon, right? There's a feel-good story!
I don't know where you're going, but would you like to battle?
Oh, you're disgustingly good!
I'm thinking that I should go to Mt. Chimney, but the view around here is very nice, too.
I'm full of pep! And my Pokémon is peppy, too!
My Pokémon lost its pep...
When I see a Trainer running around with a lot of pep, I can't help looking.
Show me how much you've toughened your Pokémon.
I see, you've toughened yours considerably.
Pokémon and Trainers learn much through battling. What's important is to never give up even if you lose.
We're training here to elevate our game to the next level. Stay and train with us!
Ooh, you're decent!
Since you're that strong, you should aim for the Pokémon League.
Please take this to commemorate the training we did together!
Oh, you and your Pokémon look quite strong. We simply must have a battle!
You didn't just look strong, you are strong!
I thought I was raising my Pokémon diligently, but, oh no, there is still much to be done.
You can make Pokémon stronger or weaker depending on the moves you teach them. What kinds of moves do your Pokémon know?
You've taught them good moves!
Maybe I should have stopped my Pokémon from evolving until they learned better moves...
This is to thank you for showing me some nice moves. Show me some more next time, too!
To train myself, I challenge everyone I meet!
Uncle! I give up!
All I can do is keep training until I can defeat strong Trainers such as you.
Since I bathed in the hot springs, I've been feeling great! I'm sure I'm going to win!
Huauff! I'm getting a chill being out of the water.
My nerves during that battle made me break out in a cold sweat. I'll have to take another dip in the hot springs.
Thanks for finding me! But we still have to battle!
I'll use my ninjutsu on you... “Volcanic Ash Swirl Cloak”! What? It's already over?
You know what's crummy about hiding? It's lonely if no one comes along.
I have a rare Pokémon! Would you like me to show you?
You... You want my Pokémon, don't you?
I have this rare Pokémon. It's enough to keep me satisfied.
I'm a Fisherman, but also a Trainer. I'm raising the Pokémon I caught.
I thought I was doing OK in my training...
I couldn't win by training Pokémon while I fished... Was I doing things in half measures?
For Fishermen, equipment is the key. But for Trainers, the key ingredients are Pokémon and heart, of course!
I was beaten in heart?
Come to think of it, fishing is a battle between a Fisherman and a Pokémon.
Take flight, my bird Pokémon!
They did take flight...
If they'd get stronger, they'd be able to fly more freely...
Good times are filled with good aromas.
Oh... I smell the bitter scent of misery...
The Berry Master's garden is filled with uplifting fragrances.
I'm from Mt. Pyre... Taste the power my Pokémon and I have attained in the place where spirits of Pokémon slumber.
So powerful...
Mt. Pyre... Where the spirits of Pokémon slumber... It overflows with Psychic and Ghost power...
Being a psychic is about willpower. I've convinced myself that I won't lose to anyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
Being a psychic is about willpower. I thought I wouldn't lose to you...
I've convinced myself that I won't lose to anyone. That makes me strong!
I feel sad...
I should train at Mt. Pyre... I'll never beat you this way...
To punish myself for being unable to win, I'll give away some of my very own rare goods.

Pokémon have many Abilities. If you want to become a first-class Trainer, learn about them.
You're obviously thinking.
The Abilities of Pokémon will make battle styles change.
I'm studying everything all over from the ground up. I figure this is my best route to being a first-class Trainer!
To be in your class still seems like a distant dream.
I'm going to start from the top again! Just as Pokémon have different Abilities, we can live our lives in different ways!
To first-class you from second-rate me... Here you go.
Why am I carrying this parasol? I'll tell you if you win against me.
A parasol can't ward off Pokémon attacks...
I don't think strong sunlight is good for my Pokémon. So, I shield them with my parasol.
Me, Pokémon, and my parasol... If any one of them is missing, the picture of beauty will be ruined.
You've completely ruined my beauty...
A parasol wouldn't suit you at all. Why, something like this would only get in your way.
There are powers beyond our understanding in the world...
I have lost...
Mt. Pyre... There is a mysterious power at work there...
With my Pokémon, I have traveled the world's four corners. You might say I have some confidence in my abilities.
Ah, well played.
I would like to circle the globe once again with my Pokémon.
With my Pokémon, I have traveled the world's four corners. You might say I have some confidence in my abilities.
Ah, well played.
You and your Pokémon... Your prowess as a team would be worthy of respect, even overseas.
Woof. You bowled me over! This is to mark the occasion of a razzle-dazzle battle!
[~ 1124]
I'll get demoted if I lose, though!
[~ 1126]
[~ 1127]
What? What's going on!
[~ 1129]
When I'm here... Some sort of power flows into me...
The power is ebbing away...
Perhaps the power is from the spirits of Pokémon in fitful sleep here...
Behind you... What is it...
Something faded away...
The Pokémon at rest here... Sometimes, they play...
I'll give you this, which I received from the Pokémon that slumbers here.
I love all things horrifying... It's like a disease... When I'm here... I shiver with fear...
Losing, I dislike...
I want to see dreadful things... I can't leave... Stay... Won't you stay with me?
We've come to test our courage! My girlfriend will love me even more when she sees how cool I am. I'll show her how cool I am by knocking you out!
I'm really scared, but as long as I'm with my boyfriend, I'll be OK! He'll try to show me how cool he is by knocking you out!
Luke: Uh-oh! Dez: Oh! I'm scared!
I lost, but that's OK! As long as I'm here, this test of courage is no problem!
We're so madly in love that we don't mind losing!
If you're gonna battle us, bring some more Pokémon! Or else how can I show my girlfriend how cool I am?
If you're going to battle us, you need at least two Pokémon. My boyfriend is so strong, one Pokémon is no match for him! 
Teacher... Please watch over my progress!
Teacher... Please forgive me!
Until I improve, my teacher, who rests here, will never find true peace...
Yawn... Keeping watch over the hideout bores me, so I'll take you on.
Yawn... Oh, I lost...
If you hang around here too long, the other members of Team Aqua might get you.
Warp panels, the hideout's pride and joy! You're clueless about where you are, aren't you? Fluster and tire out the enemy, and then lower the boom! That's our plan!
What's wrong with you? You're not tired at all!
That reminds me... I can't remember where I put the Master Ball. If I don't protect it, our Boss will chew me out...
Yawn... Keeping watch over the hideout bores me, so I'll take you on.
Yawn... Oh, I lost...
If you stick around here too long, the other members of Team Magma might attack you.
Warp panels, the hideout's pride and joy! You're clueless about where you are, aren't you? Fluster and tire out the enemy, and then lower the boom! That's our plan!
What's wrong with you? You're not tired at all!
That reminds me... I can't remember where I put the Master Ball. If I don't protect it, our Boss will chew me out...
I should teach you how harsh battles can be.
Oh. You're strong.
I'll tell you something good. If you want to reach Wallace, you need to walk on each floor tile once.
The Pokémon Gym of the highest level in the Hoenn region... That's the Sootopolis Gym.
What a high level you are!
Rather than being satisfied by being in a strong Gym, I imagine training in other places will make you stronger. But above all, it looks more fun.
Gliding across the ice in a single, graceful line... A Trainer who can do that is elegant and beautiful!
Well, excuse me?!
This is really obvious, but how strong you are as a Trainer has nothing to do with how young or old you are.
I'll show you the sublime techniques I learned from our Leader Wallace!
I'm sorry, Wallace...
Watch what happens if you crack all the floor tiles.
You came all the way here, but you won't get to see Wallace. Not if you lose to me, you won't!
You're strong! I was fooled by your cute looks!
You might be good enough to avoid being wiped out in one hit by Wallace.
I've made it this far a couple times, but the last stretch is so long...
My dream ends here again...
You've made it this far. Keep the momentum going and become the Champion! If anyone can, it's you!
I didn't come all this way to lose now. That possibility doesn't exist!
Impossible... I lost?
I lost here... That means I lack the qualifications to become the Champion...
The thought that I'm getting closer to the Pokémon League... I'm getting stage fright...
I couldn't do a thing...
The Pokémon League became distant again... What a letdown...
I trained together with my whole family, every one of us! I'm not losing to anyone!
Better than my family? Is that possible?!
I was better than everyone in my family. I've never lost before... I've lost my confidence... Maybe I'll go home...
I'd heard that there was a tough little kid around. Do they mean you?
The little shrimp is tough!
I heard a rumor that tough little kid is from Petalburg City.
This seemingly infinite and harsh road lives up to its name of Victory.
Your battle style is fantastic...
You seem to have the potential to become the Champion.
To win your way through the Pokémon League, you need to trust in your Pokémon.
Your relationship is based on solid trust.
By being together all the time, trust grows between Pokémon and Trainers.
This isn't the goal. It's only a stop on the way to the Pokémon League.
That's the way!
You'll do fine, for sure! Your Pokémon are all eager to go!
You must be getting a little tired.
No signs of tiring at all!
Victory Road and the Pokémon League are long and grueling challenges. Beware of fatigue!
You shouldn't get complacent just because you have a lot of Gym Badges. There's always going to be someone who's better than you!
You're better than me!
Gaze on your collected Badges and remember the Trainers you've faced.
Erk. How annoying of you to follow us to the bottom of the ocean! Time to put an end to this!
What was that? Even the way you battle is annoying!
It doesn't matter how hard you try. By now Archie is already... Teehee!
What an annoying kid to follow us to the bottom of the ocean! That all ends now, though.
What an annoyance! Even the way you fight is just oozing with obnoxiousness.
It doesn't matter how hard you try, anyway! By now Leader Maxie is... Heehee!
Are your friends strong?
Your friends are, indeed, strong.
Friends need not be human. For me, Pokémon are treasured friends!
Child... Did you knock on the door?
A loss is to be accepted without confusion or panic.
To never be ruffled in any situation is the Gentleman's code of conduct.
It's a bit embarrassing, but we'll show you our crazy-in-love power!
It's a bit embarrassing, but we'll show you our crazy-in-love power!
Jed: Huh... Lea: No!
We've never lost using our crazy-in-love power! You're an amazing Trainer!
We've never lost using our crazy-in-love power! You're an amazing Trainer!
Just one Pokémon? Doesn't that make you lonely?
I wanted to battle... You don't have two Pokémon, though.
Arrrgh! I'm fed up and dog-tired of cleaning this huge place! Let's have a quick battle!
Little bro, I lost!
We're the Cleanup Brothers! The old one dumps the detergent, and the young one does the scrubbing!
This is the bottom of the ship's hull. There's plenty of room. It'll be all right for a Pokémon battle.
Big bro, I lost!
We're the Cleanup Brothers! The old one dumps the detergent, and the young one does the scrubbing!
I can't swim without my inner tube, but I won't lose at Pokémon!
Did I lose because I have an inner tube?
My inner tube is a fashion item. I can't be seen without it.
Wahahah! I'm gonna catch me a big one!
I just lost one...
I think you're a big one. No, you're a big-one-to-be!
Hi, big Trainer. Will you battle with me?
Oh, you're strong.
How did you get to be so strong?
I take my inner tube with me everywhere!
Whoa, you overwhelmed me!
It's not easy throwing Poké Balls while hanging on to an inner tube!
Observe the harmony between nature and the constructed elements. This is pretty neat, isn't it?
You're pretty neat, too!
To see every last corner of this place, you'd need a Pokémon move that'll let you dive underwater...
We were looking for treasure when we found a Trainer!
Huh? We were looking for treasure when we went and found a Trainer!
Hal: We couldn't even win battling together... Lois: So strong!
We heard it was here, but we haven't found any treasure. Maybe someone else already took it.
What kind of treasure would be in a dump like this? No matter what it is, I know what I'm buying if we find it!
You don't have two Pokémon. You can't beat us like that!
What? Don't you have two Pokémon? Let's put off the battle, then.
Our Pokémon got stronger while we were looking for treasure all this time. Try facing us!
Huh? So we meet again! You're not giving up on your treasure hunt either, just like us! How about we have a battle to decide who will give up on the treasure?
Hal: You're as strong as ever! Lois: We lost again...
We can't find the treasure, and our Pokémon lost. I wanna go home! If I say that out loud, though, my girlfriend's going to get angry...
I'm going to keep training my Pokémon. And I won't go home until I find that treasure!
You don't have two Pokémon. You can't beat us like that!
What? Don't you have two Pokémon? Let's put off the battle, then.
Instead of treasure, we losers proffer this distinguished item!
Instead of treasure, we losers proffer this distinguished item!
I've been to the hot springs and refreshed my tired bones. Right now I'm feeling strong!
Oh, my goodness. Now, aren't you something!
Well, well, I've lost. I can't call myself an Expert now, can I?
If you can mesh your heart with those of your Pokémon, why, you should be able to achieve great things.
Oh, my goodness. Now, aren't you something!
Perhaps your heart has become one with the hearts of your Pokémon.
For you and your Pokémon, whose hearts have become one, a present from me...
If you're lighting a campfire or setting off fireworks, make sure you have water handy.
Thanks for dousing my fire, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with any sort of fire in a forest. Don't ever underestimate the power of fire.
Have you learned to keep water handy for campfires and fireworks?
I got hosed down before I could flare up, I guess.
You really do have to be careful with any sort of fire in a forest. Don't ever underestimate the power of fire.
My fire never really got burning, but a loss is a loss! I'll give you this!
Let my melody rock your soul!
La-lalala...
An electric guitar doesn't always have to just be noisy... It can be strummed to squeeze out this heart-stirring melody...
A melody from my Pokémon and me... Let us deliver it to your soul.
La-lalala...
When I play, my emotions should reach you through my electric guitar...
Placing this gift in your hand, I can almost hear a song surround us.

I ran out of energy!
I may have blown it... I might have dropped to last during that battle...
I'm smack in the middle of a triathlon, but I'm comfortably ahead. Let's make this a quick battle!
I ran out of energy again!
I was tops in swimming and cycling, but I'm not quite that confident with Pokémon yet.
I guess I'll give you this prize I got for winning a triathlon a long time ago.

Win or lose, you'll never know until you try!
Waah! I sank in defeat!
I never battle when I know I'll win. I like to battle at the razor's edge of victory and defeat!
I want to win like everyone else, but I won't raise Pokémon like everyone else.
Darn it! My way is still too slack!
It's way more fun to do things the way I want than to be like everybody else. I mean, that's obvious!
Okeydokey! That's enough rest, gang! It's time for a match!
Tuckered out again...
My bird Pokémon get tired quickly after a long flight...
The savage tide in this area serves to make us stronger than ever.
I concede defeat.
We will return for more training at Meteor Falls. If you'd like, you should go, too. It will definitely toughen you up!
I came all the way out here with my bird Pokémon.
You... You're stunningly cool!
I'd like to go back to Fortree soon, but for some reason I've grown to like this place, too.

Boring battles aren't worth the effort. Fiery hot battles are what toughen up Trainers and Pokémon!
That was fiery hot!
Whew, I'm all thirsty. Maybe I'll have a Soda Pop.
There's no need for Winona, our Gym Leader, to deal with you! I'm plenty good enough for you!
Winona, I... I lost!
Winona is cute and she's strong. She's the ultimate Leader! Blush...
Winona taught me personally! You can't beat me easily!
I was beaten...
Thanks to Winona, the people of Fortree can live without fear.

Through fishing, I have attained a state of becalmed serenity... Please, allow me to demonstrate.
Though I have lost, my heart remains calm...
It matters not that I catch nothing. The line remains in the water...
Whoops! Don't tell me I snagged a surfing Pokémon?
I can't keep up!
Your Pokémon look pretty strong. They'd be a handful if I hooked them!
Well, hey! This is a match between a Pokémon fan and a fishing buff!
No! My line's all tangled! The party's over!
My fishing line's doing a dance! The tangle tango! Hahaha!
We've been working so hard to mount a Pokémon League challenge... We can't afford to lose now!
Oh! How could this happen?!
After all I've done to get here, I won't give up after one setback.
There is no stronger Trainer than I!
This can't be!
There probably is no Trainer stronger than you!
What I learned at Dewford's Pokémon Gym, I will put into practice here.
I was swamped!
Brawly, Dewford's Gym Leader, used to train with a guy named Bruno in Kanto, I've heard.
I want to visit Ever Grande, so I caught myself a Pokémon that knows the move Waterfall to crest the falls.
I'm crestfallen!
Awww, phooey! My Pokémon know Waterfall, but I don't have the Sootopolis Gym Badge!
Bird Pokémon have excellent vision. They spot prey from great heights.
Whew... I give up.
There're lots of diving spots in the sea around here. You can spot them easily from the sky because of their darker color.
Say hey, hey! Let's get on with it!
Beat, I'm beaten. That's it, done!
There's nothing left for a loser. Time for me to beat it home.
What's the hurry? Let's take it slow and easy.
Oh, my. I wanted to relax a little more...
Don't you hate making mistakes when you're in a rush? That's why I try to take things slowly.

Shall we use our power as brother and sister to battle you?
Let's battle as brother and sister!
Ian: I did my best with my big sister, but we couldn't win... Rell: We couldn't even win when combining our powers as siblings.
People in Pacifidlog spend their whole lives with the sea and Pokémon.
Pacifidlog is a town floating in the sea, right? That means that Pacifidlog extends as far as the sea!
Don't you have at least two Pokémon? We can't enjoy a Pokémon battle.
If you had two Pokémon, we would give you a battle!
Aww... I came all the way down to the beach just to be with my little brother! I wanna have a Pokémon battle to take my mind off it!
My big sister has a strong Pokémon! Don't cry when you lose!
Rita: It's your fault we lost, Sam! You're in trouble later! Sam: Ughh. Sorry, Sis...
Aww... If only it were my wonderful boyfriend instead of my little brother beside me...
My big sister is really scary when she gets angry. She sometimes scares people off.
Do you intend to battle us? You need at least two Pokémon.
Do you intend to battle us? Bring at least two Pokémon!
Aww... I came all the way down to the beach only to be with my little brother! Oh! Long time no see! Let's battle to take my mind off things!
If we lose, she'll be angry with me! I'm really going to give it my all!
Rita: Sam! We lost because of you again! You're in for special training later! Sam: Ughh... Gimme a break already, Sis.
Aww... If only I had a wonderful boyfriend to team up with, I'm sure we would never lose!
My big sister is really scary when she gets angry. She's gonna make me train my Pokémon like crazy after this!
Do you intend to battle us? You need at least two Pokémon.
Do you intend to battle us? Bring at least two Pokémon!
I've got no choice... Go on, take this!
Wow... On top of losing, I have to give you an item, too...

We always have Pokémon battles against each other! I always lose, but I can win if it's two-on-two!
Lisa: Amazing! Your strength is on a whole different level! Ray: Well, your level is just too much higher.
Do you have any friends that you go to the beach with?
I've been training the Pokémon I got from my big sister! It's my cherished partner!
If you're gonna battle us, bring more Pokémon.
If you're gonna battle us, bring more Pokémon.
You spoke to me... So you want to challenge me! Sure! I'll try out the Pokémon I caught while surfing!
I don't have a clue about what it takes to win.
Go for a Surf on my Pokémon... Then fish off its back... It's an indescribably luxuriant moment!
[~ 1869]
Tate: Our... Our... Liza: Teamwork.

So I, the Champion, fall in defeat...
[~ 1886]
Go back and forth between Lilycove and Slateport, that's what I do. It's my hobby—going from port to port to take in Pokémon Contest Spectaculars.
That was an enjoyable match!
I get so excited imagining what kinds of Pokémon I'll get to see in the next Contest Spectacular. The anticipation thrills me!

You were too good for me...
You haven't seen any of the Rock type's terrifying power—yet!
[~ 1905]
Whoa, wow! You made a much bigger splash than I expected!
[~ 1907]
I'm thirsty... I could go for a Soda Pop at the Seashore House...
Groan...
I'm getting famished... My inner tube looks like a giant doughnut...
I'm hungry, but I've got enough pep in me for a battle!
I lost... It's because I'm hungry...
When you eat on a beach, everything seems to taste a little better.
Here, this is to say thanks for our battle! I am hungry, though!
I have foreseen your intentions! I cannot possibly lose!
I failed to prophesy my own demise!
I see your future... Hmm... I see a shining light...
[~ 1918]
[~ 1919]
[~ 1920]
[~ 1921]
Wahahahah! Fine, I lost!
[~ 1923]
This Gym's got puzzles! Isn't it fun?
It's no fun to lose...
Wattson says he likes setting up little traps with switches.
[~ 1927]
Oh... I guess I was trying too hard...
[~ 1929]
[~ 1930]

[~ 1932]

I'm really jealous of your Go-Goggles... My eyes hurt so bad...
My eyes... My eyes...
If you have Go-Goggles, even desert sandstorms are no problem, you know?
My eyes may sting a bit, but I'll still have a picnic here in the desert!
Ohhh! You're mean!
When you're battling in a sandstorm, watch out for your Pokémon's HP. It can faint if you don't keep an eye on it!
Does wearing those Go-Goggles make you feel like some kind of a champion for justice?
I guess I can't beat justice...
My family doesn't have that much money, so I can't get anyone to buy me Go-Goggles...
Wow, my eyes are crazy itchy... I should've brought some Go-Goggles. By the way, I heard there are Fossils to be found in the desert. Do you know where?
My eyes are itchy, and I lost the match...
If they can find Fossils in the desert, it must have been a sea once! But that doesn't make my eyes any less itchy...
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins! I'm so used to sandstorms that I don't even need goggles anymore! Am I to be challenged?
While I have searched for ruins, I've not searched for strong Pokémon.
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins! No, wait, was that 40 years? Which was it now?
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins! No, wait, was that 40 years? Anyway, am I to be challenged?
I've found neither ruins nor any strong Pokémon...
For 30 years I have searched for ancient ruins! No, wait, was that 40 years I've searched? Hmm... It could even be 50. How long have I been at this?
I found this in my 20th year of looking for ruins. I would be so honored if you would accept it as a gift.
[~ 1958]
Whoa! So strong! My granddaughter wasn't lying.
[~ 1960]
I use this parasol to ward off this filthy, yucky volcanic ash from my dear Numel.
Huff, huff... I am exhausted...
You're very good at this. I must say I'm impressed!
Oh, hello, hasn't it been a while? May I invite you to battle?
Oh, how magnificent!
You've remained very good at this. I must say I'm impressed!
To you, who are oh so strong, I offer this.
Want to find out how strong you are? I'll be the test!
You passed with flying colors!
To best even me... Your strength is marvelous!
You seem to have a big collection of Gym Badges. Let me see if you're actually worthy of those Badges!
Oh, you're worthy, all right!
You did your Badges proud in that match!
Gabby: What an awesome battle! Hey, did you get all that?! Ty: Every last bit of that battle we just had is on this tape!
[~ 1975]
... I've lost...
[~ 1977]
When we're together, nothing scares us! We'll show you how great we are!
When we're together, nothing scares us! We'll show you how great we are!
Kate: I look so bad in front of Joy... Joy: Kate, I'm sorry!
Whenever anybody is counting on me it always makes me wanna show off...
Oh! I'll have to train with my teammate some more!
You have just one Pokémon, so we can't battle! It would feel like we're picking on you.
If you're going to challenge us to a battle, you need at least two Pokémon!
I wanna show my cute teammate how strong I am!
My lovely teammate and I will team up to defeat you!
Anna: Hey! I'm in front of my teammate here! Would you let me win?! Meg: Oh no! Sorry, Anna!
Your Pokémon create quite a combination! You might be almost as great as us!
I'm holding my teammate back... If that weren't the case, we would've won!
Bring at least two Pokémon if you want to battle us!
You only have one Pokémon? We can't battle then. We want to enjoy a two-on-two battle!
I can't keep losing in front of my teammate like this...
This will be the time that my teammate and I defeat you!
Anna: I couldn't get myself in gear. Meg: You're too strong.
Your Pokémon create quite a combination! You might be almost as great as us!
Even though my teammate and I fought together, we still lost... What a letdown!
Bring at least two Pokémon if you want to battle us!
You only have one Pokémon? We can't battle then. We want to enjoy a two-on-two battle!
I would hate to burden my partner, so I'll give you this from me.
I couldn't possibly burden my partner, so go on and take this from me.

From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah! I challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
Perhaps I should battle straightforwardly without hiding... I bid thee farewell.
Even if there are no ashes, I leap! Hiyah! I challenge thee!
With honor I admit defeat!
Whether I hide or not, the results of my battles are always disappointing. The path of the Ninja Boy is harsh...
I hope you will accept this.
Who might you be? Are you perhaps searching for ancient ruins that are rumored to possibly exist according to legend?
What a disgraceful setback...
That giant rock... I would like to believe it may indeed contain ancient ruins, but I see no entrance.
Stop! Have a good look at my precious Pokémon!
Oh, how dare you! Don't take it so seriously!
Maybe I'll go catch some more Pokémon at the Safari.
My precious Pokémon grew! Have a good look!
Oh, how dare you! You still won't take it easy!
Maybe I'll go catch some more Pokémon at the Safari.
I've got no choice. Here! Take this item that I've been keeping warm with my body heat.
I train my Pokémon with Wallace. Don't think I'm a pushover.
I was bowled right over...
I think you have potential. Why don't you stay and train with us?
There's supposed to be a mystical rock around here. Do you know anything about it?
I was thinking too much about that rock, so my Pokémon remained weak...
I can spend hours and hours staring at a nice rock without growing bored.

Can your Pokémon withstand the heat from my Pokémon?!
It didn't burn hotly enough...
You withstood our heat without any trouble, so you and your Pokémon should be able to survive in magma easily.
With my charm and my Pokémon's moves, you'll be shocked!
I'm shocked by your power!
I've heard that Mauville was founded by Wattson. He was a Trainer long before we became Trainers. He must know all sorts of things!
Um... OK, I'll battle with you.
Oh, but you're too strong.
I'm going to be a pretty and strong Trainer just like Flannery.
To hide a tree, use a forest!
I bow to your superiority.
To hide a tree, use a forest! To hide a Pokémon, use a Pokémon! There is no deep, hidden meaning to that.
I will adopt the movements of Pokémon and create new ninja techniques.
The creation of new ninja techniques remains but a distant dream...
Perhaps I ought to apprentice with a ninja sensei.
We ninja conceal ourselves under our invisibility cloaks. I bet you didn't know where I was!
I lost! My invisibility cloak failed me, too!
We ninja make the papier-mâché for our invisibility cloaks by hand!
@s! How are you doing? I've been training nonstop— so I was taking a short rest. Since I managed to run into you, @s, it seems like this will be a perfect chance to see how much I've improved!
Ugh. So this is my limit.
I knew my team makeup was still off. Then...I guess I need to take this guy out. No, if I do that, I'll be wide open for... Hmm... Then if I replace this move here... Yeah... Yeah, that should do it! Oh! Excuse me! I couldn't help myself! But you're just as brilliant in battle as ever, @s! Still, don't you count on me just losing to you forever. I've met a lot of people who have helped me grow since coming to the Battle Resort, and it has reminded me all over again how much fun it is to really go all out in battle! Thanks again, @s! Let's battle again sometime!

There's supposedly a strange old man in Shoal Cave! Are you on your way to meet him, too?
Is there really anything in a place like this?
Kim: I thought we would win, though. Iris: We almost had you for a second there.
There's a strange old man in Shoal Cave, right? Let's go meet him!
Are we really going into Shoal Cave? We're gonna get wet...
No way! I'm telling you, there's no way we can battle if you don't have two Pokémon!
We would never stoop to having a two-against-one battle.
Yeah, I'm kind of in the mood to teach you how to battle.
Who taught you to battle like that?!
Tyra: What an amazing way of battling! Ivy: What an amazing way of battling!
I taught Ivy all about Pokémon!
What got me started with Pokémon was when my teammate taught me how to battle.
Ah-ha! If you're going to battle us, you'll need more than one Pokémon!
You only have one Pokémon? I feel like it must be lonely.
Oh no! I don't want you interrupting our time alone together.
Our love for each other is heating up Hoenn!
Paul: Whoa, you got us! Mel: It's all my fault we lost! Now Paul's going to hate me!
Don't tell anyone you saw us here! This is our place to be alone.
Hey, Paul, you aren't mad at me, right? That would make me so upset.
We're madly in love, so we battle with two of our Pokémon together!
We're madly in love, so we battle with two of our Pokémon together!
We're always battling our Pokémon against each other, so we're confident!
It's been 50 years since we got married... Nothing can break our bonds of matrimony!
John: Oh no, we lost, honey. Jay: Oh no, we lost, sweetie.
Wow, 50 years of marriage... Come to think of it, I've never beaten my wife in a Pokémon battle.
Yes, in 50 years of marriage... We always had Pokémon battles whenever we got in a fight.
Oh, aren't you a young Trainer?! If you're going to battle us, bring some more Pokémon!
My, you're a young Trainer! If you're going to battle us, bring some more Pokémon.
We've always enjoyed Pokémon battles as a couple, so we're confident.
Well, 50 years of marriage... Supporting each other all that time has made us a strong couple.
John: Oh no, we lost, honey. Jay: Oh no, we lost, sweetie.
So, 50 years of marriage... Come to think of it, I've been battling my wife every single day.
Yes, in 50 years of marriage... So much has happened. I hope my husband and I have even more fun times together.
Oh, aren't you a young Trainer?! If you're going to battle us, bring some more Pokémon!
My, you're a young Trainer! If you're going to battle us, bring some more Pokémon.
We bought this item to commemorate our 35th wedding anniversary. I want you to have it.
I don't know if young people these days would be happy to get something like this, but...

Oh, sure, I'll accept your challenge. I have a lot of money.
Why couldn't I win?
There are some things money can't buy. Pokémon battles are one of them...
After I lost to you, I learned a bunch of things about Pokémon.
I lost again? Why couldn't I win?
I'm fabulously wealthy, but I can't seem to win at Pokémon... It's so deep, the world of Pokémon...
If it's money, I have more than I could ever need. I've got more items than I could possibly use, too.
We must have been fated to meet. May I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my!
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.” I hope we meet again.
Hello, we meet again. May I ask you for a battle?
Oh, my... I did the best that I could...
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.” I hope we meet again.
To commemorate our battling once more, please take this as you go on your way.

My Pokémon is delightfully adorable! Don't be shy—I'll show you!
Oh, my gosh! My darling Pokémon!
My delightful Pokémon looks darling even when it's fainted!
Hi, you! My delightfully adorable Pokémon has become even more darling!
Oh! My darling Pokémon!
The more time I spend with it, the more adorable my Pokémon becomes.
I bought this item for my Pokémon, though...
Will you play with my delightfully pretty Pokémon?
That isn't what I meant!
I'm going to a contest in Lilycove. My Pokémon should have no problem sweeping the Master Rank.
The sight of Wallace conducting a battle... The very beauty of it compelled me to become a Trainer.
You battled with more beauty than I could muster...
The grace you bring to battle is fabulous. Oh... I'm so fortunate to have found Pokémon.
When I gaze upon Wallace, time flies by before I can say “oops!”
Oops!
I wish I could forget about losses as quickly as you can say “oops!”
Oh, you're such an adorable Trainer. Would you like to have tea? Or would you rather battle?
I see. You're the active sort.
A world cruise on a luxury liner has its charms, I must say... But, I will admit there is an appealing side to touring Hoenn by ferry.
Ah, you've come just in time. I'm bored, you see. You may entertain me.
...That will do.
Perhaps I shall get Father to acquire a yacht for me. A yacht for me and my Pokémon!
Ha ha ha! I would go anywhere to show off my delightful Pokémon.
Oh, dear, this won't do.
Perhaps I should groom my Pokémon for the Contest Spectacular rather than for battles.
Ha-ha-ha! I would be happy to show off my Pokémon as often as you like!
Oh, dear, this won't do.
The Contest Spectacular is delightful, but I like to battle, too.
I guess it can't be helped. A loss is a loss is a loss is a loss.

I'll make you feel the power of the number-two Trainer at this school!
How disappointing... I fell to number three...
Roxanne will be number one for all eternity! You'll be a piece of cake for her!

Oho! That's a loss I can be proud of!
Hah! Hah! Ahya! Ahya!
Hah...hah... That tired me out...

Muwuhahaha! That battle was fun even though I lost!
Hah hah... Uhn...hah hah...
Oho! That hurt just about exactly as much as I figured!
Just barely...
Oohwaahhhh!

Hey now!
You've mastered the Inverse-o-matic to such a high level! As the developer, I couldn't be happier!
I knew it would turn out like this... I'm so bummed out now...
Thanks! You saved the best for last!

As a bird-Pokémon user, I solemnly swear to battle fair and square!
As a bird-Pokémon user, I admit defeat fair and square!
Gym Leader Winona leads the way for all of us who use bird Pokémon. I began walking the path of a Trainer because of my desire to live like her.
Hohoho! You've left yourself open! With ninjutsu, I will conceal myself in steam!
This steam stings my eyes!
Flannery and I thought up the idea of hiding in steam together.
I feel like my brain is melting... Let's hurry up and battle...
I'm so dizzy...
Urk... I might've stayed in too long... My Pokémon and I are at our limit.
My Pokémon and I are proud of our stamina. We can swim all day long.
We're drowning!
I'm totally fine with swimming all day, but my body gets all soft and wrinkly.
I was born in a village far from the sea, so I've always dreamed of coming to Hoenn.
You grew up with the raging seas, didn't you?
Even the salty smell of the sea is fresh to me... I'm really glad I made this trip. I still want to make more memories on my trip, though, so battle me again!
Oh, it's you! You've come to help me make some memories!
What a good memory...
I want to make so many memories on my journey that I won't be able to fit them all in my backpack.
Thank you for helping me make memories! I'll give you this as thanks!
Are there any drowning Pokémon or Trainers here? I've taken it upon myself to go on swim patrol.
Waahh! I think I might drown!
I'd rather be a lifeguard than an athlete. It sounds cooler, right?
It is I who has come splashing over to you! Be not surprised by this Ace Trainer!
Splash...
Swept away, splashing, I am a Trainer adrift... I look forward to being swept back to you again someday!
Swept away, adrift, it has been too long! Let us drift along together!
Splash...splash...
I hope to drift away forever. I offer my life up to the waves and the winds...
This was swept here by the sea. Please take it, if it pleases you.
We Ace Trainers care not where we are when we train...or battle!
How could I lose here?
I develop my balance by standing on top of Pokémon in the raging seas.
Urp...ugh...uhh... Hurry up...guhh...and...start...
Urp...ugh...I can't take it anymore!
Ah...where's the shore? Which way to solid ground? Ugh...uhh...please... I'm uneasy here, so please come again.
Urp...ugh...uhh... It's you... You're all right.
Blechh! I knew I couldn't do it...
Ugh...it only gets worse when I move... What should I do?
Uhh...thank you for coming to see me... Take this with you if you like...
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What's the deal? Are you after my snow cone?!
Wh-where did you come from?
Oh! It melted... My...my snow cone...
Pokémon are even more lively than usual when they get out here in nature!
Even though I lost, I feel refreshed.
Sure enough, Pokémon fit better in nature than in a city.
Huh? What are you doing in a place like this? Could it be that you're lost, too?
I lost my way in that battle, too.
I was curious about some Pokémon tracks, but when I followed them, I got totally lost!
Are you looking for Pokémon as well?
You're a strong Trainer.
I think there are many Pokémon around here.
The burger I ordered is taking forever! It's making me so totally crabby!
Gosh! I'm starving!
There's something special about the food at the Seashore House, isn't there? It's not like it's particularly good or anything, but I never want to miss out.
I'm not such an amateur that I'm going to take it easy just because you're a kid.
That was the work of a pro...
Hehehe... You're a pro, huh?
Fairy-type Pokémon are highly flammable, so do be careful!
I got completely burned up.
About these Fairy-type Pokémon... How can I make them get along with Fire-type Pokémon?
Hahaha... Don't fog up my goggles!
Sniffle...sniffle...
This is no good... I fogged up my own goggles with all these tears!
Are there any ruins that would satisfy me around here?
Oh! What a mystery!
I'm traveling the world on business. All the ruins in the Sinnoh region got me really excited!
I bought this swimsuit last year, but it doesn't fit anymore.
My body feels heavy...
I swim with Water types every day as part of my fitness program, but I still feel heavy.
My hobby is Pokémon-Amie. What? You got something to say about it?!
I'm not very good at battles.
Whether it's fashion, playing, or whatever, making fun of someone's hobby is insensitive.
My face is so scary that when I walk in the tall grass, nothing appears at all...
It must be nice to have strong Pokémon...
I was having such a hard time catching Pokémon, so I decided to raise them from Eggs instead.
Oh! It's you! How have you been? Let's celebrate meeting up again with a battle!
Your Pokémon are as strong as ever.
Hmmm... If my face is too scary for Pokémon to come to me in the tall grass, maybe I should try wearing a mask...
You're as strong as ever! Consider this your allowance.
I'll tell you this right up front... I'm super-crazy weak!
See...
I have confidence in my physical strength, but I'm totally awful at being a Trainer. It was fun battling you, though. We should do it again sometime.
Oh, it's you! You're, like, back for another battle, right? I might be a little better...
Hmm...you sure are strong.
I knew it would be fun to battle you. Let's do it again sometime, if you feel like it.
Thanks for hanging out with me! I'll give you this, so use it if you'd like.
When I told everyone that I can talk with Pokémon, they became concerned for me...
My Pokémon! You aren't in pain, are you?
It's more fun to be with Pokémon than to talk with people... Battling with Trainers may be a bit fun, though...
Oh! Hello, Trainer. You must be here for a battle, no?
My Pokémon seemed to enjoy that.
It's more fun to be with Pokémon than to talk with people. Battling Trainers makes Pokémon happy, though, so I don't mind you.
That was fun. Here, take this...
Pokémon are precious companions for me on this long trip.
How did my companion do?
The toughest thing about being on a trip is being alone. As long as I have my Pokémon, though, it doesn't bother me!
I've been alive for 54 years! My life has been all about battles!
How could this happen to me?
The Pokémon from that battle and I have been together since I was born.
Whoa, you look, like, totes strong and stuff. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this...
See?! I knew it!
Honestly, Super Training is just a pain. Training Pokémon is, like, super hard.
I'm always after the big one! I've got no patience for small fries!
That one was even bigger than I expected...
The tug on the line is the essence of fishing. Excitement lies in the strong pull of a big catch!
I throw my line in and settle back to ponder all sorts of things... Like, what is a Pokémon battle?
Fishing is philosophy...
To find peace in one's heart, one must only throw in a line.
Fishing is a battle between people and Pokémon! It's no hobby or sport or anything like that!
This is a battle, too.
There are apparently several kinds of fishing rods in the world. I'd like to catch Pokémon with each one of them.
Glug...glug glug...glug! (Hey! Did you come for a battle?!)
Glug...
Glug glug...glug! (That was fun! Let's do it again sometime!)
Glug...glug glug...glug. (Another battle, eh?!)
Glug...
Glug glug...glug... (It was as fun as I expected!)
Glug glug...glug... (I found this, but you can have it!)
Glug! Glu-glug! (Hey! Who do you think you are?!)
Glu-glug! Glu-glug!
Glu-glug! Glug! Glug-ug! (The Pokémon ran away!)
Bloo-bloop... Bloop... (Oh? An invitation to battle, yes?)
Bloop...
Bloop... Bloo-bloop... Bloop... (That was fun! Do come again!)
Bloo-bloop... Bloop... (Long time no see! I've been waiting for you!)
Bloop...
Bloop... Bloo-bloop... Bloop... (Thanks for coming all this way!)
Bloop... (Thanks for coming. Here's a souvenir for you.)
Bloop-oop... Bloop-oop-oop... (The sea in Hoenn is truly beautiful.)
Bloop...
Bloop bloop... Bloop-oop... (Just being underwater puts me in a good mood.)
Glug... Glug glug... (I'm looking for a Pokémon called Corsola.)
Glug glug glug...
Glug glug... Glug glug glug... (I'm doing some Corsola watching.)
Bloop! Bloop-oop-oop! (It's not like I'm drowning or anything.)
Bloop-oop!
Bloop! Bloop! Bloop! Bloop! (I'm just searching for my prey.)
Ace Trainers can even appear in the sea! Yes, even those who can't swim!
I'm gonna fall in!
Whoa, I was just about to fall off my Pokémon. It's not easy being an Ace Trainer.
I'm wearing my swimsuit under my shirt. The shirt makes it plain that I'm an Ace Trainer.
Water splashed on me.
Oh no, my shirt is soaked... Maybe I'll just transform into a swimmer.
Oh, you wanna battle, do you? Take a deep breath and it's on!
The water stings my eyes.
Even when I'm a soaking-wet loser, the fact remains that I am one cool dude.
Actually, even if I didn't have this tube, I could still swim!
My tube got in the way!
My mom told me I have to bring my tube when I go swimming, so it can't be helped!
For some reason this tube looks like a doughnut. I wonder if it would be as delicious...
I'm hungry.
I love doughnuts! I wonder if Pokémon do, too.
I feel like I'm losing my edge just drifting along with the waves.
Losing doesn't bother me.
As I watch everyone floating on the waves, it makes me feel like everything's all right.
Apparently in the Hoenn region a legend has been passed down that it's the birthplace of Mega Evolution.
Mega Evolution, huh?
Researching Mega Evolution here in Hoenn will lead to unraveling its mysteries.
Don't lump me in with those Swimmers! We athletes have come to battle!
Will I go down in the sea?
The triathlon is known as the sport of iron men! In order to win out in this cruel battle, training with Pokémon is indispensable!
Glug glug! Glug-ug-ug-ug! (I'm right in the middle of a treasure hunt!)
Glug-ug!
Glug! Glug! Glug-ug-ug! (Underwater—now that's adventure!)
Glug-blug! Glug-blug-ug! (It's possible to dive even if you can't swim.)
Glug-glug-blug-ug! Glug-blug!
Glug-blug-glug-ug! Glug-blug-ug-ug-ug! (Diving is easy. You just have to sink.)
Bloop bloop... (Oh, you're a Trainer, aren't you?)
Bloop...
Bloop bloop bloop bloop... (You can't skin dive, can you?)
Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop! (I became a Water-type Pokémon!)
Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop!
Bloop-oop! Bloop-oop! (My dream of becoming a Pokémon came true!)
Hurry up and get started already! This sea breeze is bad for my skin!
It's over... It's over...
Between the UV rays pouring down and the saltwater, this is the worst for my skin! I hate the sea!
The trick to fishing with a rod is to put your back into it! That's the key!
Way to put your back into it!
Using your back will help you improve at fishing more than anything else. Well then, you should try it, too! Go on, put your back into it!
Once you've cast your line, the idea is to hang in there until you catch something.
It got away from me.
Patiently enduring the wait until you catch something develops your staying power.
I was just napping on the beach when before I knew it I had been swept away!
Glug glug...
The sound of the waves is my lullaby.
I'm crazy about fishing but not very good at it.
You got me.
I battle and fish because I enjoy doing those things. I can enjoy myself regardless of the result.
On a journey to the land of Hoenn... Came an invitation to a Pokémon battle.
I lost...
Having a Pokémon battle at my destination makes me feel the elegance of my journey.
Glug-ug... Glug-ug-ug-ug... (The seas in Hoenn are famous for their beauty.)
Glug-ug.
Glug glug-ug... (A lot of divers dream of coming here.)
Glub... Glub... (Can you understand my hand signals?)
Glu-ub-ub-ub...
Gluh... Glub-ub-ub... (They mean, “Battles are fun!”)
Blub! Blub-ub-ub! (Will you be my prey today?)
Blub-ub.
Blub-ub-ub! (No! You beat me at my own game!)
Bloop... Bloop-oop... (Elapsed time: 20 minutes, 14 seconds.)
Bloop-oop...
Bloop bloop-oop... (That's about as long as I can hold my breath.)
I'm not into this costume. I'm a Dragon Tamer, though, so I have to wear it!
Uhh... It's all a misunderstanding.
The Dragon Tamer uniform aims to appear prestigious. There are more than a few Trainers who have quit being Dragon-type users because of their dislike of it.
My muscles are trying to tell me something. They want me to battle you!
My muscles are crying.
After I strengthened my core muscles to the max, I became able to hear their voice!
This mural apparently depicts events in ancient Hoenn.
I learned a lot from that.
The study of history is just the same as the study of people.
I was headed to the Contest Spectacular Hall, but I seem to have lost my way.
What was that?!
I'm going to appear in the Contest Spectacular! My Pokémon and I are on our way to the big time!
I'm looking for Pokémon as long as I'm out here hiking.
I didn't even want to battle.
Maybe there aren't many good Pokémon around here.
[~ 2600]
[~ 2601]
I've no time for idle talk. Let us see your conviction.
Your conviction could even crush rock.
No words should be spoken by the defeated.
Your luck is about to run out! Your fate is to fall before me!
No!
Uhn... Even if they weren't quite cool, I delivered my lines awesomely, if I do say so myself.
You look all right for a kid. I can totally get into this!
I underestimated you!
You're really awesome! I dig you! Why don't you become one of my buddies?
Dragon types are the strongest Pokémon! I'll prove that with the likes of you!
Y-you...
You handle yourself quite well. I'll let you be my rival!
Don't come any closer! My big sister is all mine!
Stop it. Don't get too close to her!
Scall: Hey, are you OK, Sis?! Ion: ...Scall...
I don't hate strong Trainers, so we could battle again sometime. My big sister is all mine, though! You can't have her, no matter how many times you come for her!
I must admit that you have power. But I must warn you... You mustn't get too close to her.
No way! I hate being alone! I need my big sister!
Not a chance. I can't leave my sister alone.
Are you trying to take my big sister away again? My big sister and I will be together here for all eternity!
You... Could you... Could you be after Scall, too?
Scall: Hang in there, Sis! Ion: ...Scall...
It doesn't matter how many times you come back! My big sister is mine and mine alone!
Not a chance. I can't leave Scall's side...
I absolutely hate being all alone! My big sister and I battle together!
No way. I can't leave my sister alone.
I'll give you something nice! Just don't go near my big sister!
Take this. Now stop trying to get close to my sister.
Do you think you can win against we sisters who have been brought together by the greatness of Fairy magic?
We sisters, having been brought together by the greatness of a Ghost curse, are the strongest...
Elle: No! The spell was broken! Aya: Oh... The curse was lifted...
All right, time to stop playing sisters! Let's play again sometime, Trainer!
This girl lives in my neighborhood. Dealing with children is really tiring.
What?! You don't have enough Pokémon! I only do Double Battles!
Apparently this girl wants a Double Battle. Even one is enough, just bring more Pokémon.
Oh! You're the first Trainer we've met since we teamed up! We're what you call Brains & Brawn. We'll do our utmost!
All right! You're the first Trainer we've met since we formed our team! We're Brains & Brawn. Get ready, 'cause here we come!
Jael: Thank you very much! Kael: We learned a lot from you!
Wow! You sure are a strong Trainer! Please let us be your apprentices!
Amazing! I sure was impressed! Please! Let me call you my master!
Sorry, but we're a team. Please give us a Double Battle.
We want to make our way doing Double Battles. Please don't subject us to one-on-one battles.
Good morning, master! Please bestow your wisdom upon us!
Master! Good morning! Please watch our performance again!
Jael: Thank you very much, master! Kael: Master, thank you very much!
Master, you're a real genius! Becoming a Trainer like you, master, is our goal as a team!
Thank you so much for everything, master! I always learn so much from you! Please continue to teach me from here on out!
Sorry. I sure am sorry... Even if it's an order from you, master, I can't battle alone. We want to battle on as a team!
Please be patient with us, master. Even though it's an order from you, master, I can't battle alone. Please let me battle with my teammate!
Master! This is to thank you for your wisdom! It is only a trifle, but please accept it!
Master! Please take this! It may be shabby, but it's to express my gratitude for your wisdom!
Hey! Some Trainer came up and started talking to me! Go on, you attack first!
Hey! There's some Trainer talking to me! You attack first, just like we planned it!
Aden: It's all your fault! Finn: Pull yourself together!
Sorry that other guy messed things up. He's not used to Double Battles. (I might not be either...)
I'm really sorry we were so disgraceful. The other guy's still just a beginner. (I actually might be, too...)
It's quite difficult for me to say this, but we'd like to have a Double Battle.
Well, we're a team called Brains & Brawn that specializes in Double Battles.
Thank you for coming, challenger. As a servant of the Trick Master, I pierce through everything like a spear!
Welcome, challenger! As a servant of the Trick Master, I will repel all attacks like a shield!
Pike: Master... Shiel: Master...
I am a servant of the Trick Master. At least as long as he pays me...
I am a servant of the Trick Master! Even if I am just a seasonal worker!
If you wish to battle us servants of the Trick Master, you'll need more Pokémon.
If you wish to battle us servants of the Trick Master, prepare for a Double Battle!
Hmmph. You're a cute Trainer. I wonder how long you can hold out against my attack.
We're an invincible combination. We'll be burned into your memory!
Jude: Ugh... What happened? Rory: I'm so terribly sorry, m'lady!
It...can't end like this. Let's meet again someday.
Not all teammates are necessarily equals. I'm a loyal underling of this fair lady. It was certainly my mistake that caused us to lose the previous battle. In other words, a punishment of long, hard training awaits me.
Oh, that's too bad. We're Double Battle Trainers.
Sorry, but if you want to battle with us, you're going to need more Pokémon.
It has been too long, Trainer. We won't lose this time.
I'm going to burn the fruits of my training into your memory!
Jude: Ugh! What an awful mistake! Rory: Are you all right, m'lady?!
I won't give up just yet. Let's meet again someday.
Not all teammates are necessarily equals. I'm a loyal underling of this fair lady. However, since we began battling you, my mistress has placed more trust in me. At the same time, the training I do as punishment has gotten harder and harder, too. Tee-hee.
Have you forgotten? We're Double Battle Trainers.
Hey, what's the matter with you? You don't have enough Pokémon to battle.
I accept my defeat. Take this as proof of your victory.
Let me thank you for a fine battle. Please take this with you.
Glub...glub...glub... (Battles everywhere! That's what it is to be a Trainer!)
Glu-u-u-ub.
Glub...glub... (No matter where I go, battles are always the same.)
Gla-glub! Glub! Glu-glub! (Target sighted! I'll take 'em down!)
Glub!
Gla-glub! Glub! Glub! (I feel like swimming down to the depths I'm so embarrassed!)
Bloop...bloop-oop...bloop... (Hey, have you heard of marine snow?)
Bloop...
Bloop-oop...bloop... (Marine snow is proof of the sea's abundance.)
Blub! Blub-ub! (I'm looking for things that fell here.)
Blub-ub!
Blub-ub! Blub-ub-ub! (I can't find anything.)
Hmmph! That's one of Rydel's Bikes!
I expected no less from one who can handle a Bike produced by Rydel!
Mach Bikes and Acro Bikes... Knowing you, you'd be able to handle either one with no problem at all!
My role here is to test all the future Triathletes who come to Cycling Road.
You're qualified to ride all the way to the end of Cycling Road!
Please enjoy riding all around on this crazy huge Cycling Road to your heart's content!

I can't change the fact that I lost.
[~ 2754]
[~ 2755]
...
[~ 2757]
[~ 2758]
Uhhngh...
[~ 2760]
[~ 2761]
I give! I give! Whoa! You're crazy strong for a kid!
[~ 2763]
[~ 2764]
Well, it's not like I coulda beat you by gettin' just a little bit stronger, right?
[~ 2766]
Yes! That's it! That's just what I was looking for!
To defeat me, a descendant of the ancient Sootopolis people, and even when I was holding nothing back...
Yet another defeat!
Even though I knew I wouldn't win, it's still disappointing!
I'm so hungry...
Yet another defeat!
Even though I knew I wouldn't win, it's still disappointing!
I'm so hungry...
S-so strong!
Are you telling me you're that strong and still just a kid?!
That's just too strong, right?!
Your strength is no joke! That made me dizzy.
You're crazy strong, just like always...
I knew I wouldn't win, but...
I'm Amy! This is my sister, Liv! We battle together!
The two of us together make one! We always battle together!
Amy: I'm disappointed. We couldn't win. Liv: We lost again, Sis.
Taking on two opponents at once makes you think!
My sister and I were breathing perfectly in sync, though. Why did we lose, again?
Huh? You only brought one Pokémon with you! You can't battle us like that!
If you want to battle us, you have to bring at least two Pokémon! We can't have a battle otherwise!
Here, Trainer! I'm disappointed, but thanks for the battle!
Here you go, Trainer! I'm disappointed, but thanks for the battle!
Well, well, I lose again!
I expected no less of you!
It really is hot.
Spectacular!
Phew...
@s! Please see how much my training has accomplished! This time my team is the best it can be!
Gaaahhh!
Hah...hah... Maybe I need to start again from scratch. But you performed as well as I'd expect, @s! You even beat the best team I could put together! And, well, Pokémon battling really is great, isn't it? When I get to spend every day training and battling like this, I really can't help thinking, so... I enjoy every day so much that I really think I finally found where I belong. I...I'm going to keep getting stronger! So please battle with me again!
Hah...hah... Here, @s... Take this, hah, with my thanks.
An intruder? In our hideout?! You're pretty shady looking. On your mark, get set, fight!
Beaten at my own game! For a second time!
You're not an intruder? Uh...sorry. I thought you were with that girl who was in here messing up our hideout earlier.
If you want to get to the Leader, you'll have to defeat me first. Not that you would have a chance even if the whole world went topsy-turvy!
It was my Pokémon and I who went all topsy-turvy!
What's going on with you and that girl from earlier? I know teenagers can feel frustrated, but that's no reason to go wrecking other people's hideouts. What's that? You're not together? Sorry about that.
Hey! You're that intruder who messed up our base! I'mma teach you a lesson!
I got taught! Heh heh.
Huh? You're not an intruder? S-sorry for the mistake... I thought you were with that weird lady who was trashing our hideout earlier.
If you wanna get to Archie, you gotta take me out first. You're years away from being able to beat me, though!
Perhaps my Pokémon and I are the ones with years of training to do...
What's going on with you and that girl from earlier? Teenagers are old enough to know the difference between right and wrong! You can't go trashing somebody's hideout on impulse! Huh? That wasn't you?! S-sorry about that. I apologize.
Heave-ho! By fanning out, we spotted a suspicious person!
Fanning out doesn't help you in Pokémon battles at all!
I hope you just keep going straight. I'm sure it'll be fun... Tee hee.
Hey, hey, hey! Fanning out has helped in spotting a suspicious person!
Fanning out has nothing at all to do with winning Pokémon battles!
You should just keep going straight. I'm sure it'll be a riot... Tee hee hee.
Just like I'd expected of you, @s...
It's no surprise! I hate to admit it, but you're pretty strong!

[VAR PKNICK(0000)] doesn't seem to want to do any Core Training. Maybe you should try using a training bag with it when it's feeling a bit more energetic.

If you want to catch Bug Pokémon, you had better wake up early.

Hard-bodied Pokémon!
I started planning for today's hike a whole month ago.
Lovey-dovey strategy!
Lovey-dovey Pokémon!
We're lovey-dovey! We'll be lovey-dovey forever!
We put everything we have into it!
The first Pokémon I ever caught.
My Pokémon and I have grown stronger together.
Attacking with Rock-type power!
Rock-solid types are good.
I want to learn all about Pokémon through battle.
Direct physical action!
Fighting Pokémon rule!
The world awaits me as the next big wave in training!
I choose to electrify.
Get shocked by electricity!
Wahahaha! The secret to good health is being willing to laugh!
Battling aggressively.
They burn with passion's flames!
You can wash away your daily fatigue with a nice soak in the hot springs!
I flexibly adapt my style.
Those grown in a balanced manner.
I've chosen to dedicate my life to Pokémon, but the road is hard...
I get my advantage through speed.
Those that dance gracefully in the sky.

We battle in cooperation!
Pokémon that are always friendly!
We can read each others' minds—and the minds of our opponents, too.
With dignity and respect.
I prefer Pokémon of grace.
Aquatic illusions best suit my distinctive sense of elegance.
The best defense is a good offense!
The aesthetics of the Dark side!
You can talk all you want—all that matters is how strong I am, right?

I wonder how my grandma is doing at Mt. Pyre.
I make use of items to assist in battle.
Flaming passion in icy cold!
The Ice type can be trained to greater levels because of the heat here.
Harnessing the strongest stats.
The latent power of Dragon types!
I battle every day to understand and be understood by my Pokémon.
Strike enemies where they're weakest!
The ultimate Steel-type Pokémon.
When it comes down to it, I'm just the strongest there is right now.
You've just got to have a feeling for it.
I love them all!
I want to make some memories. That's why I want you to battle me.
I leave that up to my Pokémon.
Fairy types, I guess.
I love Pokémon. It's people I'm no good with.
I just let myself go with the flow.
Pokémon that know Surf.
I'm a Trainer who likes to splash about drifting in the troughs between waves.
A stable kind of battling.
Large Pokémon that I can ride on.
I get “surfsick” real easy, but even when feeling bad, I'm not too shabby.
Start small and build on it!
Popular Pokémon!
We're a Brains & Brawn kinda combo!

It's a secret.
Our sisterly bonds cannot be broken.
We make an exquisite combination.
Anything is fine as long as it's strong.

I never let up with the pressure.
I like cool ones, y'know.
Y'know, it really hurts when people say I look scary...
Like I care about that.
C-cute ones!
I, like, seriously go all out. So you'd better, like, seriously be ready.
I attack like a forceful, crashing wave.
I guess it'll have to be Clamperl.
I'm always deep in the ocean waters, but please do come and visit me.
It's all about endurance!
Relicanth is cute, isn't it?
Drifting in the water is as comfy to me as lying in a soft bed.

This great stretch of ocean connects the cities of Lilycove, Mossdeep, and Sootopolis.
Small children are allowed to play in the waters of this sea route as far as Shoal Cave—but no further!

It is said that a Pokémon once dwelled here in the ancient mists of a time long lost.
A long-sleeping Pokémon will descend upon this cavern in order to awaken its true powers.
This challenging path forces Trainers who hope to overcome the Pokémon League to first surpass their own limits.
This cave's appearance changes greatly between high tide and low tide.
Though it was planned to be a subterranean city extending 69 floors underground, this project died in development.
A facility that was decommissioned dozens of years ago. It is now maintained as a natural preserve.

Have we met or not? I don't really remember. Well, I guess it's nice to meet you anyway!
Yahoo! YAHOO! I did it! I won again!
No way... NO WAY! How could I lose again...
All right! Here I come! I'll show you my power!
You amazed? You surprised? By the power of my Pokémon?!
Whoa! You are incredible! I'm amazed and surprised!
B-b-bonjour, Dresseur! B-battle, s'il vous plaît!
Merci bien!
Aw, sh-shucks!
Don't let your guard down, or you may be crying when a kid beats you.
I may be young, but that doesn't mean I'll lose—even to a grown-up.
Sheesh! Can't you see that I'm just a kid! It wasn't fair of you to go all out like that!
Let's have a fun Pokémon battle!
Hehe! Mehehehehe! See? It's fun to win!
That was pretty amazingly fun! You've totally exhausted me...
A serious battle starts from a serious beginning! Are you sure you're ready?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is seriously the best!
Seriously, I lost. That is, like, seriously depressing, but you were seriously cool.
You'd better go easy on me, OK? Though I'll be seriously fighting!
I can't believe I won! Wait... Did you seriously go easy on me?
Hey! I told you to go easy on me! Still, you're pretty cool when you're serious.
Um, um, um, you know what? These Pokémon are my friends.
I...I'm sorry. I just wanted to show you my friends...
Just being with my Pokémon makes me happy, so it's OK!
...Heehee. I'm confident in my calculations and analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned... There's no way I would lose.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis are perhaps no match for chance...
We're about to battle, but that doesn't mean we can't be polite! Good luck!
That could have gone better, but I do thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration, but I do thank you very much.
I've been studying every single day, so I'm taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun. I want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost... Maybe I'll stick to studying.
I want to be a Pokémon researcher when I grow up.
Do you think Pokémon research projects need any test subjects?
I must do my best to learn even more about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong... I hope I'll be all right...
Oops, you weren't as strong as I expected. Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer! What you see is what you get, right?
I always get the best grades! I aim to be number one in everything!
I will keep winning and winning and winning... I will be number one!
If I lose at such an early stage, I can't be number one...
Wha—? You wanna battle with me? I suppose we could arrange something...
Ah, I shoulda known. Hey, don't blame me.
Oh, wh-whoa. I'm no match for you. Your Pokémon are somethin' else.
Grumble, grumble...
Grumble, grumble... Huh? Did I win?
Grumble, grumble... Oh? Was that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe, a mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell. I'm worried about your future, kid.
I really let myself get carried away this time. I hope it doesn't affect my future prospects.
Are you my opponent? You look kind of hungry.
Hmm. Have you been eating well? Can't fight on an empty stomach!
Are you sure you're normal? What in the world do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity, so I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you've lost to me. Now, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you my lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon. I don't think they'll lose to you.
You see that? I'll be fine as long as I listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mama-a-a! Waaah! Make the mean Trainer go away!
Ahhh, a Trainer who looks gorgeous! I hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost to me?! I'm a little disappointed.
Oh my, our battle was just as gorgeous. I feel drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like? Hey, come on, show me!
Your taste in Pokémon is wonderful, but you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful, but you are a first-class Trainer!
I'm sorry—I've been lying. I'm not really a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me when I pretended to be rich.
The truth is that I'm nothing more than the daughter of a Clerk ♂.
Ahahaha!
Ahahaha!!!
Ahaha-argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you! Oh yeah! Nice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna! Tank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost! Tank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler! I'm already prepping for college.
You lost to a Preschooler... And how old are you again?
I'm confident in studying, but I'm just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am the hero! I refuse to lose!
I AM the hero! I beat a villain!
A hero never loses. A hero never dies.
I am very strong. I will never lose.
Daddy gave me my Pokémon! They've gotta be the strongest!
WAAAH!
No pouting when you lose, 'cause that's just lame.
I'm so happy, I could c-cry! Yip-yip-yippeee!
Awww, s-sniff! I losted on my battle... It's sad, but I s'pose it's my fault.
Are you gonna pick on me?
You didn't pick on me. So I guess I like you!
You did pick on me, after all, but I like you 'cause you're strong!
Game on, Pokémon! Give it all you've got!
Mmmm-hahaha! Yahoo! Yahoo! Thank you very much, Pokémon!
Booooo! Come on, Pokémon! Try harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best! Trainer, you should do your best, too!
I'm four years old! I did my best! Trainer, you were really weak.
I'm four years old! I did my best! Trainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala... I am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala... Drifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala... Till we meet again...
I am not just an ordinary Backpacker, 'cause I'm also a newlywed, you see!
My new wife and I are hitchhiking for our honeymoon, 'cause we have no money.
This is my honeymoon! B-but... But I've lost my wife somewhere...
Hitchhiking around the region without a cent to your name has its own charm.
See? Travel is best when you're young and poor.
Argh... I'm so hungry... Can you please spare something...
It's no holds barred on this journey! Where's my adventure?!
My journey... No, my adventure of a lifetime hasn't even begun yet!
The journey isn't over. Just you wait! I'll show you the greatest adventure ever!
The truth is that I'm a time traveler. I just popped by from the future.
Even if I lose, I can just jump in my time machine and go back to the past to try a battle again!
Yes, traveling through time... That's how I go!
You know, the prices in this region are really quite something, aren't they!
Though the level of the Trainers in this region... Well, they're nothing worth writing home about.
I couldn't possibly live in a country where everything costs so much!
Sometimes I need a little time to rest. I'm gonna take it easy this battle, OK?
That was a nice and easy win. I'll work hard again tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing, but now I feel more stressed out.
All I want is to work hard, save my money, and live a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream. I just want to have a normal life.
I'd rather simply have security and happiness than chase a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! I've got some real plump and lively Pokémon right here!
What do you think of my Pokémon? They're fresh!
Thanks for coming! What'd you think? Did my Pokémon suit your tastes?
Didn't you come here for a Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or you will never win.
You are a strong Trainer. Forgive my impertinence.
Hiya, honey! Welcome, welcome! Have you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation in a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory in a Pokémon battle, sunny-side up.
Meow, meow, I can haz battle, meow? (Ugh, I really sound like a fool, don't I?)
Yeah! Meow! I haz victory, meow! (I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I haz lost, meowww. (This job is sooo embarrassing.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than anybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves my true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should've helped me win...right?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon I am proudest of?
What do you think about my  dear Pokémon? Great, right?
Oh my goodness! My poor Pokémon...
Here I go! I battle for the honor of the branch office!
I am a branch manager of the Pokémon Fan Club—and I won!
Urk! F-farewell for now! I'll remember this, child!
I lost a lot of things because I love Pokémon too much...
I have devoted my life to Pokémon. I see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion. What shall I do?!
Listen, I love Pokémon more than life itself!
I'll be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too! Please, let me pet them!
I'm not good at battling, but this is one of the duties of a Poké Fan.
I've kept the honor of the Poké Fan alive. Hahaha!
Cheers, all you Poké Fans out there! May the Poké Fan last forever!
My middle-age spread has given me as much gravitas as the mountains I hike!
Bwahaha! You'll win, too, if you just up your calorie intake a bit!
At least I cannot lose when it comes to BMI!
I am no mere Hiker. Call me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me is properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters. That's an alpinist.
I'm bursting with dreams and desires! I'm just a bundle of youthful vigor!
Dreams are important! Desires are important!
I'm so full of dreams and desires that I'm about to burst! But that's what it means to be young!
Is it really OK? Do you really think someone like me can be a Trainer?
No way... I'm actually pretty good! Or are you just a total amateur?
Ahhh... I knew I'd be terrible at it... I can't call myself a Trainer like this...
Anyone can stay young if they keep stars in their eyes and dreams in their hearts!
I won't tell you how old I really am, but I can say I'm old enough to be your mother!
All you have to do is ignore reality, and you can stay young forever, too.
If it's cute, fluffy Pokémon you want, leave it to me!
A harmony of strength and cuteness... That's what I'm all about!
A fragile ephemerality... Yes, that's another of my charms...
My dear cuties whisper all kinds of secrets to me...
You see? My cuties teach me all kinds of good things.
Why don't my cuties say anything? Why do they seem in such a bad temper?
I won't be going easy on you just because you're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You can't do battle if you're afraid of losing.
Harrumph. I'm still weak. I pity my Pokémon...
I may be bad and stupid, but I'm serious about Pokémon.
I only really feel at peace when I'm with Pokémon.
I hope you'll find something you can be serious about.
My amazing punk hair is the secret to my power.
The more I spike my hair, the stronger I am!
If you want to be even stronger, you should get amazing punk hair, too!
What d'you think you're lookin' at?! You've got some kind of nerve, kid!
A hard chick like me doesn't need anybody else to fight! My Pokémon are all the backup I need!
Amazin'! I got schooled from here to Hoenn! You gotta take me under your wing, boss!
I'm Callisto, the boss of the Kalos Coalition. It'd be my pleasure to take you on in battle!
Phew... You've got some good Pokémon on your side, all right.
Well, ain't you something... All right, then. I'm stepping down—you're the new boss!
The guy I like is, like, totally bad... I'm gonna be real bad for that cad...
The gals of the Kalos region, like yeah... Ooh, ooh, ooh, we battle, ooh yeah...
Gals of Kalos don't take it on the chin... Ooh, ooh, ooh, you'll regret this win...
Non, non! A dash of defeat is not called for in my recipe book! C'est pas possible!
Ouais! Where is the life? Where is the vigor? It would not even tempt a half-starved Skitty!
Bon sang! What spice! What kick you have! You must tell me your secret ingredient!
S-so you've come to challenge me! Get too close, and I will sauté you!
It...it...it's all your fault for challenging me! Next time I'll turn you into a tasty concasse!
Stop! Just hold on a moment! I don't want to be flambéed!
In the land of feasting, I am king! Nay, I am the Emperor of Eating!
Ahhh, the Emperor of Eating is satiated! I polished off your Pokémon in no time!
I-I give up my seat as Emperor of Eating... Take care of my precious land of feasting...
Wanna give me a hand with my training? It's all for the sake of my future dreams!
Your defeat is another small step toward my dreams coming true!
What! B-b-but my future... Have you seriously considered what defeat will do to my future?!
Talent? Hah! It's just a convenient excuse lazy Trainers use to explain away their losses.
Talent is not something that can be gained, and strength grows weak if it is not used.
So-called talent is no more than an illusion... The efforts of one's own are all that is real.
In the words of an ancient warrior, “Conquer the self, and you will conquer the opponent.”
What do you wish to do now? Shall I leave and relieve you of your shame?
Ahhhh! What a crock! If I can't even conquer you, then who cares about conquering myself?!
I'm gonna give it my all. It's only natural! You can only get results by doing battle!
How does it feel to lose? Obviously, I wouldn't know.
Whether you give it your all or slack off... All that matters in the end is who wins...
Hmph! I'm no servant of yours!
No one but my master will ever make me bow!
U-ugh... Rather strong, aren't you? I suppose I might not mind serving you...
Are your preparations complete? I would like to ask you for a battle.
A strength equal to that of my master... I look forward to your future progress.
Oh no, what a disgrace! I'm sure my master will dock my pay for this.
The master I was serving disappeared one day. Now I am a masterless Butler—a ronin retainer!
Oh, Master, where art thou?
A Butler without a master is really no more than a meddlesome old man.
Oh no! I forgot to take off my uniform before I came!
Wow! Seriously? I won a battle?! There's no way I'm going back now!
Ahhhhh! And I lost! This is not my day.
You know, I am very popular thanks to this costume of mine.
Being popular is simple. I like life to be simple.
It feels good to be popular, but sometimes I feel achingly empty.
Welcome, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0908)]good sirfair lady. Shall I take your coat for you?
You must be tired. Please do rest awhile.
That was superb, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss! You are strong indeed.
I used to be popular, but now I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success. I took it for granted, and I didn't work hard.
As times change, values also change. I realized that too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses. If you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I'll do a sketch of you as you are now, frustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait! I'm sure I can create a masterpiece with you as my model!
Sensitivity is important for battles, too. You! Start feeling right now!
You need to feel it more! More! Or you'll never win!
Ah! I sense it! I sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Action painting? That's, like, so last century. Art today is all about inaction.
Inaction doesn't mean do nothing! Did you hug an Electrode with the Static Ability or something?
Inaction may be the rage for art, but maybe it's not such a great strategy for battling...
Inspiration... I need inspiration... Someone, please, inspire me!
Ah! My muse! She has not abandoned me! I can feel it coming—the inspiration I need!
Hah... Hah... No, not yet! I still need more inspiration!
I dabbled in art like I dabble in Pokémon! Dabbling is what keeps me from the rabble!
Hee hee hee! That was quite the scrabble! Even if you weren't very good, I still enjoyed it!
You may think I'm just babbling, but I sure love my artistic dabbling!
I'll show you we can break you. We've been training in the field!
How were my Pokémon? Powerful, weren't they?
How strange... How could this be... I shouldn't have been outmuscled.
Oh, you look lively! What d'ya say we battle?
OK! We're all done here! How were my partners?
My goodness, you are so young! My partners were crushed!
Pokémon battles after work are the one joy in my life.
Ahhhhhhhhh! Yes, that hits the spot! This is why I can't give up Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh... You got me good! I'm single... Battling is my only pleasure in life.
Pokémon are popular at work, too. Even us guys enjoy these battles!
Aren't I good for a guy who just battles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy battling with Pokémon.
I've trained and trained myself without stopping, so now I'm as fast as the wind!
No one can stop me now that I'm as fast as the wind itself!
Ow! Ow! Ow! My face! I'm the poster child for windburn!
I pledge myself now to the great roller spirits! My love, my hopes, my vow... It's all for you!
It's like some sort of dream. Shall I embrace this, too, great roller spirits?
Skates alive! What a battle!
Who was it?! Who's the bad-mouther who said that I'm just barely skating by, huh?!
I would never just skate by in battle! Even if I am wearing Roller Skates!
I-I can't even skate by anymore? That's it... I'm done. I'm retiring.
I've skated all the way here today! Over fields, mountains, and valleys!
That's right! If you only have a pair of Roller Skates, you can go anywhere!
Hah... Hah... All that skating... It really took it...out of me...
Halt, fool! I am the guardian of this castle's gardens! A ninja of nature!
Bwahahahah! My Pokémon's ninja skills are without equal!
Gasp! What maliciousness was in that move?! I see. So you must also be a ninja...
Stop! I'm going to have to ask you not to move. Just sit back and see what I do with my shears!
What a shame. It looks like I've dulled my precious pruning shears on an ordinary weed.
You have shown quite the cutting prowess... I shall sharpen my shears to face you again.
If you don't have great Pokémon, you'll never have a great battle.
It seems like you don't even understand how great your Pokémon could be.
It looks like I didn't properly appreciate how great my own Pokémon could have been...
My last ever battle... That's the way I'd like us to view this match...
We will meet again someday... Heh. If only that were true...
It's been fun... Let's have another last battle again someday...
My disciples cover the world! I am the owningest of Owners!
I can own any Owners, after all. I can't be defeated that easily.
Sacre bleu! As of this day, you've owned the Owner of all Owners!
Having carte blanche only leads to disaster. No, I was never well suited to be an Owner.
Victory is a shallow and fleeting illusion.  Your eventual defeat is a fait accompli.
They say with age comes wisdom, but that never seems to have worked for me.
Adults have learned a lot of things kids don't get. Like what is right...and what is fair...
Let me guess... You spend a lot of time blaming adults for things you think aren't “fair,” don't you?
Getting older is a one-way ticket. I regret nothing!
I've recently remade my life completely! I've been reborn as a Beauty at last!
If you want to make your dreams reality, then you have to be completely dedicated!
Yes, a mere half year ago I was a Black Belt! Quite the transformation, wouldn't you say?
It's only the first day of my honeymoon trip...and I'm already missing home.
Enough already! I just want to go home! I miss my mother!
Sob... Sob... Who needs this? I'm going home to my mother!
Are you lost here? Are you lost here? Brother John, Brother John.
Winning bells are ringing, winning bells are ringing. Ding ding dong! Ding ding dong!
Now my head is ringing, now my head is ringing. Ding ding dong! Ding ding dong!
It's my honeymoon! I'm on my honeymoon! I'm definitely not a crazy lady traveling alone!
A-and I'm on my honeymoon, you got that?! That's the most important point to remember!
I-I've got a husband... No, really, I do... Because this is my honeymoon...see?
Hoard your money, then spend it all shopping! We're making the economy move here, people!
If you don't work, you can't shop till you drop! I work hard so I can waste my money like this!
Though I guess I should probably be buying local...
A true Monsieur should have a liking for battles.
A true Monsieur should bask in the elegant glow of his victory.
A true Monsieur should accept the results of battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are at the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are at the level of a Poké Fan.
You can learn much from a mature woman, such as wisdom, grace, and good manners.
Woo-hoo! Take that! Were you knocked out by this Madame's charm, or what?!
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Ah-roo! Let us have an elegant and unique battle.
Ah-roo-goo-lah! I was not confident of  my skills, so this is a delightful surprise.
Ooh la la! I'll pay you back for this someday!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon... Pokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon, even if you lose a battle.
It is important to nurture and train each Pokémon's characteristics.
Hmm, do you discipline your Pokémon? Pampering them too much is no good.
No matter how much you love your Pokémon, you still have to discipline them when they misbehave.
Too much praise can spoil both Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you. They return all the love you give them.
This proves my Pokémon have accepted my love.
It's about time for me to give a human my affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for training good Pokémon?
The real trick behind training good Pokémon is catching good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips for training good Pokémon.

Hello-how-are-ya? Are ya in good form? I'm Nita. Welcome to the Battle Maison, pet. Sure, I may be the youngest of us four Battle Chatelaine sisters, but I'm still a class Trainer. I've been an owner of the Battle Maison this long while. Honest, I'm not telling fibs! I'd be in charge of the Single Battles myself. Would you do me a favor? Of a bit of a match? You will? Grand! Then let's begin at once!
Would you look at the cut of me Pokémon! What a battle, and me not trying for real even! Oh, I'm scarlet for you, pet. Made a complete and utter hash o' that one, didn't you now? But get you a bit more training, and you'll be grand. Trust me, training's your only man. The Battle Maison and Nita are both here and waiting for a challenge every day o' the year! We'll always be waiting for you! See you then!
That was great fun! En't you a jammie one! But I'll tell you nicely, did I not hold back... Well... G'wan with you! If I were to pull out all the stops, it'd be none too nice for our guests, eh. My older sisters are always on at me about that! Sure, I let you have a win this time... But if you seriously want to battle against me, you wouldn't be goin' astray to train up a bit more. Thanks a mill! You come back again sometime!
Uh-umm... W-welcome to the Battle Maison... My name is Evelyn... I'll t-try t-t-to serve you as a Battle Chatelaine like my sisters, so... I'm the th-third of us four. M-my specialty is... Double Battles... I guess... Umm... ... ... ... Th-the weather is in a  lovely way today, isn't it? ... ... ... Oh, please! I'm sorry, but... Please s-start the battle already!
I'm s-s-so sorry! I didn't m-mean for anything like this to... It wasn't supposed to happen like this! I would have lost, I would! Oh no... I'm supposed to make sure that our fine guests have a grand time! Sniffle... Sniffle... S-sob... I'm so sorry... I'll be sure to r-really lose next time... So please... Please come and challenge me to a Double Battle again...
O-oh! Fair play! You're quite strong, aren't you, guest! Now that I've seen how strong you are,  I feel I shouldn't have held back. It's just that my elder sisters had asked me to take it a bit easy on new guests... The next time that we battle, I will try much harder to beat you! P-please continue to patronize the Battle Maison... And to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'm Dana. Thank you for coming. I am the second eldest of the four sisters who run this Battle Maison. I am also a Triple Battle expert! So come at me, young challenger! Yes, the extent of your strength... I will be weighing it in a moment!
My, my, my... What a pity. Is that the end of things for you? I thought you had potential, but you can't get blood from a stone, after all. Away with you! I'm not interested in wasting time with weak Trainers! If that's difficult for you to accept, come back and dare to challenge me again. And if you're just going to give up, then why not just run home now to lick your wounds in shame?
Gasp...gasp... That was quite...the performance... Truly... You and your Pokémon...are truly... Ehh, leave it out! Let's drop the act. Good [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]ladgirl, yourself. That's the best trouncin'  I've had in ages. Sure, in ages! In fairness, I put on a bit of a show for the guests. But I can't act so high 'n' mighty after a savage battle like that one. Now, you leg it this instant before  I consider fighting ye again right now! Away ye go and keep on winning! 'Cause if ye do... I'll show ye my real skills. Ye'd do well to mind yerself then!
If you're free for a time, come on by. ♪ If you're bored for a while, stop on in. ♪ Battle till you burst, oh, won't you try. ♪ If you want to battle, the Battle Maison's fine. ♪ Hee! What do you think of our song, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0C06)]my ladyoung missie? We had it written just for our wee Battle Maison. Music can be a lovely distraction. Don't you agree? Oh, me. I've not even introduced myself, have I? Well, don't bite my head off! I'm the eldest of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters. Do call me Morgan. We all thank you for coming to visit our cherished Battle Maison today. I tell you, I may not be a first-class Trainer, but I'll put everything I have into treating you to the loveliest battle you've ever known!
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? I do hope you might find your way to stop by our BP shops as you go. We have cracking good souvenirs for remembering your time here at the Battle Maison. I'll be taking me leave now, but I do look forward to your next visit.
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? Get out of the garden! I had no idea you were such a fine Trainer! It's not just that you're fearsome strong,  though you are, of course. You have real style to you, too! Heh heh! I've taken quite a shine to you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0408)]fine ladgirl! But, unfortunately, we've run out of time for our wee battle today. I wait with bated breath for the next time you come to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison![WAIT 30] I'm Dana. Thank you for coming.[WAIT 30] I am the second eldest of the four sisters who run[WAIT 30] this Battle Maison.[WAIT 30] I will praise your bravery, at least, in attempting[WAIT 30] a Multi Battle with me![WAIT 30] And, of course, I am hardly alone![WAIT 30] ... ... ...[WAIT 30] Oh, give me a break, Evelyn![WAIT 30] It's your line next! Come on!
Dana: Oh, goodness me. Isn't this a shame?[WAIT 30] It looks like you're finished already.[WAIT 30] Well, at least you weren't any worse than I had[WAIT 30] already expected you to be...[WAIT 30] Don't you agree? Evelyn?[WAIT 30] ... ... ...[WAIT 30] Oh, for pity's sake, Evelyn! Wake up![WAIT 30] I'm morto for them and you! Honest!
Dana: Ugh...[WAIT 30] You're not bad, that's for certain...[WAIT 30] To think that you would be able to break through[WAIT 30] our perfect combo...[WAIT 30] But my real stage is the Triple Battle![WAIT 30] And Evelyn's speciality is Double Battle![WAIT 30] If you took either of us on in our own specialties,[WAIT 30] we'd never lose to you![WAIT 30] Isn't that right, Evelyn?!
I-I-I'm sorry, Dana...[WAIT 30] U-um, my name is Evelyn...[WAIT 30] I-I-I'm usually in charge of Double Battles...[WAIT 30] ... ... ...[WAIT 30] U-um...so...well...[WAIT 30] I'm not all flash like my sister Dana when it comes[WAIT 30] to talking...[WAIT 30] ... ... ...[WAIT 30] U-umm! Please! I'm sorry, but...[WAIT 30] Please start the battle already!
Evelyn: Huh? Wha-what?[WAIT 30] D-did you say something, Dana?[WAIT 30] I-I was so nervous...that I don't remember a thing[WAIT 30] o' the battle.[WAIT 30] Sniff...sniffle...[WAIT 30] Oh, I am scarlet for myself...[WAIT 30] U-umm...I... I... I...[WAIT 30] Th-thank you for the battle![WAIT 30] P-please visit the Battle Maison again![WAIT 30] N-now...excuse me!
Evelyn: Wh-wha... Well, I never said...[WAIT 30] I-I don't really think I'm all that good at[WAIT 30] Double Battles either...[WAIT 30] A-and the reason that we just lost was because[WAIT 30] I'm so slow...[WAIT 30] S-so I don't think these guests should expect[WAIT 30] much from me...[WAIT 30] I'd look a bit silly... Please...[WAIT 30] Pick anything but Double Battle...[WAIT 30] N-now then... I'll excuse myself...[WAIT 30] Thank you for the battle...
W-w-welcome...[WAIT 30] To the B-Battle Maison...[WAIT 30] U-um...[WAIT 30] We would like to thank you...for choosing a[WAIT 30] Multi Battle today...[WAIT 30] S-so...um...[WAIT 30] You will be facing my elder sister Morgan[WAIT 30] and me, Evelyn, today...
Evelyn: Th-th-thank you very much![WAIT 30] Y-your Pokémon were brilliant![WAIT 30] I-I will also work hard, so you'll never be stuck[WAIT 30] for a challenge...[WAIT 30] So please...[WAIT 30] Come to visit us at the Battle Maison again...
Evelyn: Um, fair play, you two![WAIT 30] You were both so very strong![WAIT 30] Th-the truth is I was nervous facing two strangers[WAIT 30] at the same time.[WAIT 30] So I don't know what I did...[WAIT 30] B-but I will try even harder the next time that we[WAIT 30] have a Multi Battle...[WAIT 30] So please d-do definitely ask me to join you[WAIT 30] in a Multi Battle again.
Evelyn? Are you ready to begin?[WAIT 30] Are you nervous again, pet?[WAIT 30] Remember, it is very important to greet our[WAIT 30] precious guests...[WAIT 30] I know some of these goofs like it when you[WAIT 30] waffle about, so that's fine for business, but...[WAIT 30] ... ... ...Hmm?[WAIT 30] Oh? Oh! Were you earwigging?[WAIT 30] What a cheeky bit you are![WAIT 30] I should not have been discussing[WAIT 30] personal matters in front a guest.[WAIT 30] L-let's just get straight to the battle, shall we?[WAIT 30] And not before time![WAIT 30] Evelyn and I will do our very best,[WAIT 30] though we're both quite hopeless at this!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you two![WAIT 30] Did you enjoy our wee little combo?[WAIT 30] I've two other younger sisters, sure, in addition to[WAIT 30] my shy Evelyn here.[WAIT 30] If you happen to meet either of them, I trust they'll[WAIT 30] show you a good time.[WAIT 30] We'll all be looking forward to your next visit then![WAIT 30] Don't work too hard!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you![WAIT 30] Did you enjoy our little combo?[WAIT 30] Our Evelyn is quite reserved, so she gets a wee bit[WAIT 30] nervous in these big battles.[WAIT 30] But she'd take you on handily in a Double Battle![WAIT 30] I hope you'll claim a Double Battle with her soon.[WAIT 30] And of course I'd be tickled meself to see you in[WAIT 30] one of my Rotation Battles.[WAIT 30] We'll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30] Don't work too hard!
Glad you made it! It won't be an easy job from here.
Haha! What'd I tell ya? You're not ready yet.
I got a little carried away earlier, but what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and my dad are Ace Trainers. I'm probably an Ace, too!
I want to be a real Ace like my mom and dad.
Waaah! I should have superior genes and be able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you will get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see? You didn't focus on the battle. That's why you lost.
That's quite enough focusing. Stop staring at me like that!
Father... Mother... Watch over my battle...
Father... Mother... Did you see? I won a battle... I really won!
Father... Mother... What should I do?
I came here to goof off. I don't want to cram for the big test...
I can't lose now... I don't want to study anymore!
No! I don't want to go home! I don't want to have to study!
I just want to be successful and grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and put you to shame.
I don't care who you are or where you come from.
How should we act and react? That is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it? After all, you are yourself, right?
Pokémon battles and study sessions are much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient. You need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker? I can't believe it!
I have more money than I know what to do with. There's nothing I really want.
The only thing I enjoy is a Pokémon battle...
Just because I'm rich, it doesn't mean I'm happy.
Yes! I'm a Rich Boy!
Good-bye! You've been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci bien! You've beat a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun, but I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance. Please don't pay it any mind.
It's good to battle for fun. If it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a battle. I'm rich—I always have fun!
I've never done a day of work, because I'm loaded with cash.
No work and all play makes me a dull girl. Do you think I don't know that?
Go, my precious Pokémon! To battle! Rush the enemy!
My Pokémon are the mightiest! I shall carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't. Someday, I will win.
I came here for my big brother who always hides in his room.
My big brother, look outside for once! I won for you! So come out and play!
I wish my big brother would come out of his room and play with me...
Hello, me old china, time for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write, Trainer, many clinks!
Even though I lost, I'll be fine. Best of luck, Trainer!
All Mom and Dad do is mumble at their computers! It's no fun!
I don't like Mom or Dad or their silly computers! All I need are Pokémon!
I wish they would talk to me instead of their computers...
A globe-trotting young adventurer. That's me!
Seeing Pokémon from all over the world is the purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me. Farewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy with Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need some breathing room, too.
No problem. No problem. I'll have another chance.
Eww, don't tell me this is one of THOSE regions. You expect me to tip the plebs?
Hmph! Looks like no tip is necessary. Then I guess this region isn't all bad.
Tsk! I'm not paying any tip, you hear?
Every time I travel, I find myself thinking the same thing. Do you know what it is?
That in the end, east or west, home is best.
That if your life can really be changed by traveling, you haven't been living it right.
I'll always work part-time, 'cause it lets me focus on what I really love.
You only ever get one life to live. Are you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever without being tied down.
I took this job because I wanted to see smiles on people's faces.
Oh... Don't look at me like that. Smile! Smile!
Losing is frustrating, but I'm glad I saw you smile.
Let's start the battle! Time's a-wasting!
What? Is it already over? We still have lots of time.
WHAT?! It's already time? And we can't go into overtime!
I'm battling here to promote the café that I'm working at.
You're not that strong, so we don't need you in our café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer! Come to my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokémon Fan Club! Your life will be happy!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club, you'll be strong, like me!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club, your life will be saved!
I am not a regular Poké Fan. I am a major mega-Poké Fan!
I love Pokémon... I love, love, love Pokémon!
Remember this, you! I am a big Poké Fan!
I think I am a Poké Fan, therefore I am a Poké Fan.
The Poké Fan is power.
You should remember this: I am a Poké Fan.
There are young and beautiful people, but youth is different from beauty.
If I'd only known that when I was young, I wouldn't be having such a hard time now...
Youth is just youth. I wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing in my way, aren't ya?
Yahoo! Yahooooo!! Hear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared down into some dark crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm a Hiker with a cult following!
Oh no! It's over already? The Hiker hunk is bored!!
This is important, so remember it: don't judge a book by its cover!
Even if it's tough, even if it's painful, I'mma do it! I'm a Trainer, dagnabbit!
I was born to do battle, ya hear?! I'm a darn tootin' Trainer! I am!
Blast it all! And it's all mah own fault! I've gotta apologize to mah sweet Pokémon!
Just because they're both decided by who wins and who loses, don't liken a battle to a game!
Fair play? What're you talking about? Is that some kind of loser thing?
This...this can't be... How could I be beaten at my own game...
My wovely widdle Pokémon are gonna take you apart, mmkay?
Don't you worry your silly widdle head! I'll take away ALL your pain, mmkay?
Oh phooey! Don't you ever come back! If you do, we're gonna end you, mmkay?
Like a fragment of a forgotten dream, a mysterious Pokémon beckons to you...
Shhh. Rest now and close your eyes... You won't ever need open them again...
Being defeated by you makes this waking world seem even less believable than my dreams...
Everyone should just disappear! I don't need anyone but Pokémon!
Humans should be gone from this world! I don't like anything or anyone but Pokémon!
Wh-why do my Pokémon look like they are having so much fun battling you?
You have your way. And I have my way.
I will go my way because I don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky. Good luck to you. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me, or I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me, but what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move? Gaaahhh, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans, but I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad if they see that I've become a Punk Guy.
I can't be like my mom and dad. So I've gotta live as a Punk Guy.
Y'know, the truth is I really wanna be a normal girl and be all lovey-dovey with a normal boyfriend...
Sniffle... Maybe it's 'cause I'm so stupidly strong that no normal boys come near me...
I just want a boyfriend! No, not just any boyfriend— I want a silly boyfriend I can be lovey-dovey with!
Man, the bad things I used to get up to... I've done a little of this and whole lotta that.
This, that, and the other were like my thing, you know what I'm saying?
But I guess that this and that are two totally different things, huh?
You wanna fight me? You do know I come from a long line of punks, right? You've got guts, at least.
I'll let you go this time. Get stronger, then come back and fight me again.
Heh... I regret nothing... It was a fight worth my family's honor...
I'm warning you now—if you lose to me, you'll be smelling the rank scent of defeat!
Mm-hmm! So fragrant! Such a bouquet! Let me get another whiff of victory!
Hm, hm, hm! There was no avoiding it! Your Pokémon give off a real aroma of victory!
I, the great Dariole, fear nothing under the sky!
Mehehehehe... You fool! You know not your place!
Feh! I will at least admit that you have a skill for feigning strength.
“Une apple a day keeps ze doctor away.” Are you familiahr with zis saying?
You are what you eat, n'est-ce pas? And it seems you could use a pinch of ze winning.
If you want to win, ze whining, it will not help! Neizer will ze wurst, I'm afraid...
Y-you... How can this be... It is like seeing my former master alive in the flesh again!
Thank goodness... In terms of strength, at least, you have little resemblance to my former master.
Even your strength is just as my master's was! P-please! Allow me to serve at your side!
The International Butlering Competition is drawing near, so allow me to practice my skills on you!
Now, let's see... If I accidentally beat my master... I know! I get on my knees and beg for forgiveness!
Now, let's see... If my master easily defeats me... I know! That is the ideal moment for some flattery!
Always workin' me to the bone, like I ain't even worth their time of day or nuttin'!
What a waste! If only I could beat those rich jerks I work for this nice and easy!
What a bunch of louts! Don't they even get that I'm always working my tail off over here!
Talk is unnecessary... I will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have very low self-esteem, so I like having someone else give me orders.
Well, you're not my master, so I guess you can't help being weak.
Ohhh... Could you please give me an order?
This isn't a uniform—it's just what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime. Doesn't it look good on me?
I wish I could live in the worlds that I see in games, anime, and comics.
I'm not cut out for a regular job, so I make my living on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they're so carefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah! If I could do a regular job, I'd quit this stinking art in a second.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move, my heart trembles!
Nothing stirs the soul like Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful! I could almost faint!
I will make you cry, 'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion can also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value of defeat and sorrow.
(This kid looks like a real sucker. All right!) Ohhhh, poor me! No one understands my art...
I'd love to do a painting of you, you know. (Because I could sell it for a mint! Hah!)
Please come to the gallery to see my works! (You look dumb enough to buy something!)
The battle between us two... Within and of itself, that is art.
Yes... I shall name this piece... “The Pitiful and Somehow Unsightly Youth.”
Yes... I shall name this piece... “The Tragic and Yet Alluringly Beautiful Artist”!
I collect the random scribbles of Pokémon, then sell 'em as “art.” I'm makin' a fortune over here!
It's like stealin' candy from a baby! I'm livin' the good life, all right!
The ones to blame are the ones who buy this junk. They're the ones who think it's worth something.
The job site can be quite dangerous, but I have to keep working with my Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well, and it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I won't be able to make any money tomorrow with these injuries!
Welcome, welcome! Step right up! Step right up and battle a spell!
Only the winner! Yes, sir! Only the winner can celebrate!
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day. Am I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down the smooth running of this machine!
I guess I'm happier than a person who cannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker that everybody's always talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus! Good-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker everybody talks about!
There are no such things as brakes on MY skates!
I won't stop! Well, I can't stop! Hey, that's just the way I roll!
They've gotta be defective or something! Please! Someone! Anyone! STOP ME!
I started skating because I'd heard that girls liked guys who skate. It's not working at all.
Tell me the truth... Roller skating isn't even cool anymore, is it?
And I'm terrible at Pokémon battles, too! Now I'm never gonna get a girlfriend...
No matter how speedy the Pokémon is, I'll catch it on my super-speedy skates!
No Pokémon or Trainer can escape me on my speedy skates!
Man, I'm so speedy and smooth! I should be on “So You Think You Can Skate!”
Five seconds. You got that? I'm gonna wipe the floor with you in five seconds.
What? You say that was over five seconds?! Time moves differently in my world, OK?!
The moment that I hadn't beat you in five seconds, I'd already lost...to myself.
C'mon, pal. I'm just a newbie over here. You're gonna take it easy on me, right?
N-no! This is, uh...just a fluke! I really am a noob!
Whatever. That's, like, sooo amazing. You really showed me, huh? Really.
Ngh! Nosebleed! When I get too excited, my blood pressure goes through the roof!
I just can't stop these blasted nosebleeds! Every time I get excited or nervous... Argh!
Uhhh... It's not...stopping... I'm starting to feel...kinda...dizzy...
You're a rather delicate-looking little thing, hmm? Sure you're up for a battle?
See? What did I tell you?  Are you ill or something?
Whoa-ho! Sorry for jumping to conclusions! Who'd have ever guessed you were strong!
Hey! You! Yeah, you! Let's work up a good sweat together, right?
Hey, don't sweat it... Sometimes you've just gotta learn to let it go.
You had me sweating bullets there! That's what being young is all about!
I didn't choose to be born a woman, OK? I didn't choose to grow up and be beautiful!
Hey, it's not like I chose for the battle to go this way, all right? Don't go blaming me.
Appearing, battling, then disappearing again... It's not like I was born just to play this bit part!
Breathe deeply of my perfume before you go. Get a whiff of a real Beauty's aroma!
Oh my, did you get too close? What are you, some kind of perfume fanatic?
The truth is that my “perfume” is nothing more than the scent of my cheap fabric softener.
The endless process of entropy... That is where nature's true beauty lies.
It is only right to be who and what you are. Do not fight it. Just leave yourself in fate's hands.
You don't understand? Well, neither do I. It's really just something I heard somewhere.
Ooh la la! Little Trainer! Graceful blossom! I'm going to snippety-snip you right at the stem!
La, la, oomph! Now where shall I  start pruning, eh? Snippety-snip!
N-non! Not so fast! I mean you to be the prize bloom in my garden!
Watch out! You're on the menu next!
What a pushover you were! That was a piece of cake, my little cream puff!
Oh... I think I'll go back to the kitchen and have a nice slice of some humble pie...
Ready for the big game? Got your cap on straight?
My oh my! My Pokémon knocked it out of the park!
Hey, another out. So what? We'll come back! We always do!
Grip and rip, baby! I'm going to capture every moment of this trip for posterity!
Here, here! Take my camera, and get a shot of me looking awesome after beating you in battle!
I don't need any memory like this! Who wants to remember their failures? Delete!
Three-star restaurants? Shopping? Sightseeing? It's all so...so ANNOYING! I'm about to lose it!
Everything is about what SHE wants to do... Exactly what part of this is “our” honeymoon, huh?
You'd better remember this for your future, kid. Nothing ruins a honeymoon quite like a spouse!
Farewell, hearth and home and all I know! I shall become a Tourist!
Yes, a man must take at least one great journey! Even if my $1 flight ended up costing me $400...
I leave my beloved family behind in my hometown and set out upon my lonely journey of a lifetime!
An airplane that soars across the sky, leaving trails of jet stream behind it... That is how I fly!
Indeed! This is my moment of takeoff! I'm taking off from you! Eat my dust!
To think that I was grounded due to you... Ohhh! I'd better get a hotel voucher at least!
I can't tell my new husband now, of course, but the truth is that I used to be a Punk Girl!
Hiding any unpleasant details of my past... Ain't I just the picture of a perfect wife?
Ehhh, off with you! If you don't, I'm gonna make you listen to me gush about my husband all night!
I'm going to battle you with the Pokémon that my darling gave me as a symbol of our love!
A win for the love between me and my darling... It will burn forever!
Y-you defeated the symbol of our love... Does that mean that we're over already?
I have raised these very special Pokémon using a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak depending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this. Did I administer the wrong blend?
Shall I share an exclusive tip for training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book of Pokémon training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD of Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family! See the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters! Our family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My...my family! What have you done?!
What you like doing and what you're good at doing aren't always the same.
I'm good at battling, but I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job, you have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
Let me be brief. You cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because you are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good. You are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I am old. I'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong! I can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat such a helpless old man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon...but I have no one to carry on the family business...
If I'd had a child like you, my golden years would have been carefree...
I wish my son were as mature as you are.
I feel sad whenever I see a bright, young child like you.
The first flush of youth... It is too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin... I won't get them back.
Don't you think it's a bit too much? This kimono? But, well, I can only pull it off while I'm still young.
The kinds of fashion you can pull off have a pesky expiration date. We call it “age.”
And, well, I suppose that when I'm older... This kind of getup will be too much hassle!
The story has it that this precious kimono was passed down within my family for generations...
Excuse me! Would you keep your distance! What if you got my precious kimono dirty?!
Look, truth is that “passed down for generations”  thing is a joke. Who'd be caught dead in this?
Hey! It's me. It's me! The Owner of the world!
How's that? Owned, suckah!
Pffft! I wasn't seriously trying or nothing! Next time I'll show you some real ownage!
Watch out! I'm always ripped and raring to go! Show me a Pokémon that's beyond the beyond!
Take that! My Pokémon have never even heard of words like sedate!
Not yet! My Pokémon can still stand! It's not over! They can still stand!
My research will lead this world to peace and joy.
I am a genius. I will control the future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed to lose against someone like you...
Only my research is left in my life. I abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life to research, is it?
Dedicating yourself completely to something can cause loneliness.
Mwahahahaha... Please lend me a hand for my experiment.
Mwahahaha... Yes, I did it! The experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good... The experiment was a failure...
You must face off against my super-powered-up Pokémon!
Well, it is only the natural outcome. The power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have a strength beyond the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me with my latest experiment!
Mwahahaha! You lost! Now step right this way, Subject A...
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up as my new test subject!
Why do people compete and fight? This is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your opponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Fooooo!
Eeeeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense. Pretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport are the height of vileness.
Defeat is worth nothing. Losers don't need words...
Heh-heh-heh. If you lose, I'll turn you into a Pokémon.
Heh-heh-heh. From today on, you are already a Pokémon!
Next time I see you, I will turn you into a Pokémon with my power.
I normally only ever listen to classical music, but if I lose, I think I shall try a bit of new age!
New age simply refers to twentieth century classical composers, right?
Is this the dawning of the age of Aquarius?
Heheh... I see it all clearly... You are a doctor from an evil planet, aren't you?
That was some kind of loss. Was there some sort of trap?!
Ugh... My powers... My powers are... I think I need a nurse...
You certainly look pleased with yourself. Just being near you makes me gloomy.
Now you've been dragged down, too. I think we could become friends now.
I hate the happiness of others... I'm just that sort of person, OK?
I praise your courage in challenging me! For I am the one with the strongest kick!
Haha... I probably did not have to use my strongest kick on you.
Oh. The Pokémon did the fighting. My strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Sup! I'll give it all I've got! Let's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough, friend! You gotta value your life, yo!
'Sup! Good work. I tried everything I could, but I'm still pretty disappointed, yo!
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to try to impress me. You can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's hard to say good-bye, but we are running out of time...
Are you ready? I'm taking my gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league. This is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost! Who are you?!
I sure would like to do the fighting instead of my Pokémon, if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a challenge. I want it to be personal!
Ah, I tingle with excitement. I sure would like to fight...
Halt at once! You there! Let us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield!  Please spare me!
When I am surrounded by nature, most other things cease to matter.
I won the battle. But victory is nothing compared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness of nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I was born a city boy. I yearned for country life.
Do you have a nice small hometown? If so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a small hometown to go back to, 'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature and all the Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order, I will put them in jail!
Protect Mother Nature! Or I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect Mother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich, healthy environment and for the sake of Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by gathering money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn. Let me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won without your Pokémon.
You seem quite confident. I'll sink you straightaway.
I am devoting my body and soul to Pokémon battles!
AAAH! I am sooo scared! I will never do it again... Sorry!
I'm working very hard, but that doesn't mean that I'm strong.
You're a strong Trainer, so I think I was just lucky this time.
What?! Even I can lose?! But I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but I became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have clear goals. That's just the way it goes.
But I'm still not cool even though I've been recognized as an Ace...
The main character of this story... I'll tell you who it is!
The main character of the story is me! You are just an extra!
Of course, you are the main character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle against the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time on such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho ho ho! That was to our liking! We find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and fight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be satisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well. You could be an Ace Trainer.
I can see the despair in your eyes. Bring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected. You should consider starting over from zero.
Did I underestimate you? Or was it your true ability that let you win?
Hey, you, young Trainer. I'm utterly stylish, aren't I?
I'm so stylish, I hypnotize myself! You'd better keep your distance!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me. It's so hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you who doesn't know anything about battles.
You really are an amateur. No sweat. (Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner? Hahaha... I-I knew that, of course!
Ugh. Cough, cough! I don't feel so well. Please show a little kindness...
I lied when I said I didn't feel well! Veterans will do anything to win!
You're very sharp! You didn't fall for my fake sickness, huh?
Come. I will give you a taste of a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon? Defeat tastes quite bitter, doesn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat. And yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute! Come, I promise to be nice this battle.
You are just too, too cute. You are! I want to see you again. I'll be waiting!
Your battle is too cute, too! Let's play again sometime.
Oh? Aren't you a child? Who said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature. Come back when you've learned a bit.
I thought you were a child. Hee hee... You are tough...
Don't you call me a Veteran! A woman is always young at heart!
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon! I'll stay fit and ready for both all my life!
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and my back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker. I have lots of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack, aren't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag! Oh... Wait... My Bag has a hole...
I'm not traveling in search of freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage, but do you really need it all?
My Bag is like the sky... In other words, it is empty.
Oh bother! It's just SUCH a hassle the way that I am always winning with my Pokémon!
Oh! Bother and vexation! This is just too much! I can't stand how good it feels to win all the time!
Hey, can't you take a hint? I was trying to fake you out!
They say that the rich don't have to fight for anything, but I LOVE a good battle!
This buzz after battle is the best! It's like I just closed a big deal!
If you want to dream big, then you'll need to build up a whole lot of experience in battle!
Hey! Hey! Please check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that? I'm proud of my Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that! Please leave my Pokémon alone...
Being a Garçon is my disguise, and it helps me live a quiet life.
On my days off, the real me can appear! Yes, I am an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living, so I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest. I don't think I will lose to you.
Did you think you could beat me with such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard. It sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant for Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will order a full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon, not a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Harooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the great mountain range of your life! Overcome me if you can!
Hahaha! I am the summit, and the road to reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain! This is my summit!
I'm gonna give you an experience so sweet that your eyes are gonna spin!
The dazzling romance of battle will make you grow into a real adult...
Phew... You are smoking hot! It's like a sweltering summer night in here!
The pretty-suited Pokémon soldier who sprinkles love on the world appears!
Take that, evildoer! I am the pretty soldier of “Prettiness and Pokémon”!
I can't be defeated yet... I still have to protect all that is pretty in the world...
Scary places are the best to me. I'd love to live in a cemetery...
Healing sites are nice, too, but they can't hold a candle to haunted sites!
In a cemetery where the party begins after the day ends. Yes, that's the life for me...
I may look like this now, but I was once a Beauty, too, you know!
I'm super popular with ghosts, but we have very ethereal relationships.
After I was dumped by my boyfriend, I fell into depression. Before I knew it, I looked like this!
I can really cut loose in Pokémon battles without getting scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why Pokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya? You're my new pal!
My 'net friends said I wouldn't be taken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared... Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
Eek! I should've stayed in my room with my PC!
Sorry, pal. Nothing personal, but I'm abouts to go all kinds of crazy on your Pokémon!
My bad, my bad! Little too much for ya, huh? But there's no pullin' punches in a fight, amirite?
Arghhh! You little—! That HURTS. But, well, that's how it goes, yeah?
Yo. You ready to start this already? I ain't long in the way of patience.
Sucks, don't it? If you don't like that feeling, you better be ready to do anything to win!
That's fine by me! I like a strong partner! But you'd never take me in a bare-knuckle fight.
I'm about to serve you up a slice of battle so exquisite you'll think I'm the cream of the crop!
So? It was delicious, right?! Have some more then! MORE!
Stop right there! We haven't reached the final course yet!
Slobber... Oooh, a tasty-looking Trainer and Pokémon have wandered my way...
Yum-yummm, you all look delicious... Bagon appetite!
Mehehehe... Got away this time, did you? I'll definitely be Gulpin you down next time!
I used to get two minutes of sleep per day. Being a Butler was one hard job.
I don't know if they thought I was a Butler or a robot...
Change! It's time for a change! I couldn't take that kind of job a single day longer!
I'm tired of doing nothing but serving... So I think it's time for you to serve me!
Outstanding! From this day, you may call me “Master”!
No...wait... Don't run away... You're supposed to be my Butler...
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange. I feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah. I'm all achy...
I really feel blah... I think I'll go home.
A child like you cannot understand the kind of beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a loyal servant to beauty. Ugly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...is you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon. I'm enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will become a good memory when you grow older.
Experience hardships when you're still young. Old bodies just can't take them.
All right, then. I'll watch you. Let your passions run wild!
What? You're done already? No, I'll have none of that!
Heheheh... Are you sure? Don't you think you could keep going?
Heehee! If you wanna see some of my art, it's displayed all over the city!
Who needs a gallery, huh?! The streets are my art show!
The days that I spend dedicated to my art... That is the art of youth!
If you work diligently, you will get results.
You, keep trying. Master the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently, things don't always go as hoped.
I've arrived from a distant island. May I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be  grateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon, my wife is fit to burst with anger!
Pokémon battles are so much fun. There's no way I can quit!
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife is as scary as a Legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days...so I gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me from boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you, I just melt.
The thrill and adrenaline has me racing! You look like you're almost standing still!
By putting yourself into a corner, you draw out your full potential!
Everything feels clearer when you get this excited! I can't stop this dangerous game!
I won't get mad if you beat me. It's just a game, after all!
Don't get mad over something like this. There are things in the world more worthy of anger.
It doesn't matter at all who wins or loses a game. The one who had fun is the real winner.
You have to cut down on resistance if you want to go as fast as you can!
I want to melt right into that blurry scenery that you can only see when going so fast.
Perhaps I could have gone even faster if you hadn't resisted me?
I'm the infamous “Cannon Girl” that all the town is raging about! I'll blast right into your heart!
I'm fast! I'm strong! I'm lovely! Nothing less for the Cannon Girl!
Blast!
Lemme tell you, I'm mighty strong. Don't come whining to me after I warned you.
Well, aren't you quite pathetic? This is what happens when you can select an opponent.
Hey, now, just a minute there! I haven't lost this thing yet!
Do not mistake the means for the goal. That is what my master once taught me.
The battle is just the means. Victory is always the goal.
For you to defeat me like this... What is the goal you strive for?
Oooh! I've spotted some handy prey! The hunt is about to begin... Game on!
C'mon, prey! You've gotta struggle a bit more, or it's not any fun for me!
Ohhh, a strong enemy! Is there a continue option somewhere?
My Pokémon are my pride and joy, so take your time and enjoy this battle with them.
Your Pokémon seem to be lacking a wee bit in the power department, friend.
Ahhh... That's a fine, good Pokémon you have. How would you fancy a wee trade?
“Harsh” and “bitter” are flavors in any good Chef's repertoire! Would you like a taste?
Your battling was bland, I'm afraid. What did you expect to happen when you're so unseasoned?
Yes, the harshness of that defeat... The bitterness on my tongue now... It's perfect!
I'm going to tell you something valuable: never expect much from a famous food!
You expect too much of something famous, and you just end up disappointed by reality.
“It's even better than I thought it would be!” If you can think that, you'll walk away happy.
All right then. Let's all be good little children and start our Pokémon lesson, shall we?
Oh my... It looks like you'll be repeating this lesson.
Oh my! You've passed with flying colors!
Hey... Can I ask you a question? When did you start loving your Pokémon?
I've always loved my Pokémon. I really thought that was true, but...
I guess it's more important to ask how long you'll keep loving them, though, isn't it?
Being called a Beauty doesn't excite me at all. It just seems like cheap flattery.
Certain types of people use sweet talk no matter what you look like. It's meaningless.
It's just plain creepy when someone uses compliments to win your attention. Ugh!
Come on, let's get on with it already! No need to worry about particulars!
Regrets from the past, worries about the future— forget all that! All that matters is here and now!
Even if I try to forget, I can't remember... That's probably all I need to know, isn't it?
D'ya, uh, know where my little lady is? Seems like she's gone up and missing...
Someone like me winning something like a battle? City slickers sure are weak these days, ain't they?
My little lady's never been to a city like this'n. May've bitten off more'n we can chew. Uh-huh.
Don't these kind of guided tours make you feel like you're really not used to traveling?
Who was I kidding—going on a trip? At home, I just hide inside. By myself...
Why'd I bother screwing up my courage to come on a trip anyway? I should've just stayed home...
Ahhh! Blast! Where'd that useless husband of mine get off to now?!
Ditching his new bride like this... He...he can't possibly be getting cold feet now?!
You're even wilder than my new husband... Oh no, this is just...
Woo-hoo! My husband got food poisoning, so now I get to do whatever I want to do!
Ahhh... It's so fun and freeing... I guess I really am best suited to the single life...
Though the truth is that I just made him a TV dinner because I wanted some time alone!
I have made them too strong. They are beyond my control...
It's all over now... Nobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down... You've saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon you have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do? I expected more from you...
Wow! You're amazing! You've trained some great Pokémon!
Take a look at these Pokémon—I raised 'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon. They're my friends and my treasures.
You're a strong one, sure 'nough. But I don't plan to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder. I can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal to me, aren't they?
They are too attached to me. They are not fit for battling.
Monsieur? What's there to be so sure about?! I'm sure I'll bring you down, that's for sure!
Argh! I hate being so sure all of the time! I don't want to be a Monsieur!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this! I will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once... “Eyes! Aim for the eyes!”
What my brother told me was right... Thanks, Bro...
I lost against a kid, Bro... I should've listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just because I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child to accept, but money does make the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits I learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer. I'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, blossom, and bloom! This woman flowers in triumph!
I want to fall while still in bloom, rather than dying on the branch.
In my country, we say that white can hide all manner of sins. Isn't it great?
But wait—doesn't that mean wearing white makes it clear you've got something to hide?
Oh, forget it! I'm done with fancy clothes! I'm ditching this outfit and going to get a tan!
I had no plans for the weekend, so I ended up wandering here before I knew what I was about.
The fact that you are so strong... It means you have too much free time, doesn't it?
Before I knew it, I'd been here for ages. But I'm not lonesome. Of...of course not.

Hi, how are you? I'm Nita! It's been a long time, Trainer! You haven't forgotten me, right? I might go mental if you say you did, with how I've been waiting! I know you're the only Trainer worth the challenge, and no guff! So let's get cracking on it!
Eh, that was a savage battle, all right! So what do you think of a serious Nita now? Quite the change? I hardly know myself! I know some folks think I'm a bit of a layabout,  but I'm one to relish a real challenge. To battle a Trainer like you is one for the books! The Battle Maison and Nita will always be here and waiting for your visit, lovie! I'll even wet the tea, so come on by soon!
Wahey! That was such great fun! You really are a strong one, Trainer! It's been a long time since I've been defeated like that! So... I can hardly wait myself for the next battle between us, you bold thing! The Battle Maison and Nita will always be here and waiting for your visit! You'd better come again—and no guff!
Uh-um... Do...do you remember me? You don't...do you... Of course... I-I'm Evelyn... U-um... You really are a strong Trainer, aren't you, dear guest? Ah... I don't want to fight... You look too scary... I want to go home... O-oh! I'm so sorry!!! I know how fed up my sister would be if she heard me saying such things! L-let's just have the battle, shall we? I'll do my best! Honestly, I really will! You can fight with all you've got!
A-a-ahhhh no! A-are you all right?! Oh no... What do I do... I must have lost me mind... Ughhh... I'm s-so sorry... I promise I'll do it right next time... So please...please come challenge me to a Double Battle again...
Hah... Hah... You're so strong... And so scary... I can't take any more... Um... Dear guest... I'm s-so sorry... I...I tried as hard I could, but... I'm so knackered... I'll keep trying harder, so...please... You must challenge me to a Double Battle again...
Aye, in fairness, I knew a cracking Trainer like yourself would make it! So let's get straight to the battle! Both me and my Pokémon are delighted and excited about facing you again. Sure, and I don't need to be telling you, but... It'll be bad for me if that sister o' mine hears that I  battled you without keeping up my wee act... So get your Pokémon out and let the battle begin! Here I come, ready or not!
Hehehe! What are you gawking at now? The savage mess you made o' the battle? Ha! I'm not havin' a dig at you—it's just great fun to battle hard after holdin' back! But I can tell you could be stronger yet!  Come back when you've upped your game, eh? Oh, and one last thing, pet... Don't go tellin' me big sister that I battled you seriously, will you, lovey? Th-that sister of mine... When she tears into a person... Well, n-never mind. Just come back again, ye great lump! I'll be waiting!
Whisht! To think I'd lose again! And I wasn't holding back in the slightest! Don't I look a right fool now! What in the world are you, pet? But...hehehe... It was really good fun, wasn't it? I've been so bored battling lately, but now I feel proper satisfied... I'm going to keep getting stronger. Then I'll surely beat you! So until I do, you'd better not be losing!
If you're free for a time, come on by. ♪ If you're bored for a while, stop on in. ♪ Battle till you burst, oh, won't you try? ♪ For a good battle, the Battle Maison's just fine. ♪ You're a good 'un, guest. It's a pleasure to me that you keep coming to see us. My name is Morgan. Of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters, I'm the eldest. I've been counting the days till I might face  you again. Let's get started with the battle at once, and mind yourself that you don't lose! I tell you, I may not be a tip-top Trainer... But I'll put everything into treating you to the most smashing battle you've ever had!
Thank you for the battle, love! It was a bit of fun, eh? By the by, here's something you might like. You can use communications to challenge the  Battle Maison here with your Friends. So find a Friend and come to visit us again! I'll be taking me leave now, but I do look forward to your next visit, pet!
Just the outcome I would expect... Honestly, I'm not telling fibs! You really are the Trainer I thought you were, aren't you now, pet? Heh heh... Might I ask something? Would you consider working here? I think we'd be famous in a day if we had someone as good as you here. If we were as popular as all that... Oh, what a profit we would have! I'll even fix you a special outfit, so you will match us Battle Chatelaines! There would be a few contractual stipulations... For one, you'd need to live here at the  Battle Maison for the rest of your life. Let's not talk about it anymore just now, but do consider the idea, won't you, pet? I shall wait eagerly for our next battle and for your favorable reply!
Hi, how are you! It's Nita's turn! Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'll be doing Multi Battles myself with my eldest sis, Morgan, today! Oh, but you two don't look all that fierce strong anyway, do you now. I don't doubt I could take you both on alone and do a handy job of it, too. Well, let's get cracking!
Nita: Th...thank goodness... Thank goodness I could win... If I lost to the two of ye now... My sister would've... She'd've... Aye, I would've had to leg it...
Nita: No, no, no! How could I— This is terrible altogether! How could you do this to me, you wee, rotten Trainers?! Do ye not even know what Morgan'll do to me now?!
... ... ... Now, Nita? Did you honestly think I'd ever let you get away with saying such things? Our guests don't look strong, is it? You could beat them both, is it? You go throwing shapes like that, you had better be ready to leg it! And aren't I always warning you about the way you speak to guests? Is your head cut, girl! Have you not a shred of scruple in your body? If you lose now, you'll never hear the end of it!
Morgan: ... ... ... Well, Nita. Lucky for you, your opponent was having a rough day, so you were able to walk away the winner. I'll do you a favor this one time only. But you had better remember what I'm telling you. Understand? You're too old to be so bold. If you greet guests with that kind o' cheek, they might not ever return. Now, my dear guests... I hope you'll hear my apology and allow me to beg forgiveness for my sister's rude words to you. I hope you'll see fit to return to our Battle Maison.
Morgan: ... ... ... NITA! Oh, I'll do you, you little waster! First, you mouth off to our guests, with your boasting and insulting them so... And then you lose in battle despite it?! Do you even take this work seriously?! Could you ever face our dear ma and da, rest 'em, after such shocking behavior?! My dear guest... I am deeply sorry for this experience. I beg you will somehow overlook it and come visit our Battle Maison again. Now I must have a...discussion with my wee sister. You'll excuse us...
Welcome to the Battle Maison! My name is Dana. I am the second eldest  of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters! Let me introduce my partner for this Multi Battle.  Nita?
Dana: ... ... ...[WAIT 30] We have retained our victory.[WAIT 30] However, I must apologize[WAIT 30] to the both of you, I'm afraid.[WAIT 30] My sister Nita should not have attacked[WAIT 30] you like that without any warning.[WAIT 30] Such behavior reflects poorly on[WAIT 30] the dignity of the Battle Maison.[WAIT 30] Nita! Are you even listening?[WAIT 30] Apologize to them this instant!
Dana: Nita![WAIT 30] We only lost the battle because you went and[WAIT 30] started it without waiting for me to be ready![WAIT 30] The key to any Multi Battle is being[WAIT 30] in perfect sync with your partner![WAIT 30] Can you not get that through[WAIT 30] your thick skull, you moppet?!
Eh, you and your innocent act, Dana! Forget the show! Let's just get on with it.  Is this to be a battle or not, eh? I'm always up for a challenge, and I'm ready to start right now! There! You're wide open! I'll take you down!
Nita: Ah, yer sister! Why should I?[WAIT 30] They're the ones at fault for being wide open![WAIT 30] I swear, Dana, you'll drive me crackers[WAIT 30] with your rules and manners.[WAIT 30] Pokémon battles should be fought as we like,[WAIT 30] and who's to tell us otherwise?[WAIT 30] As long as it's good fun for everyone,[WAIT 30] where's the harm?[WAIT 30] I'll stake my life that you secretly agree with me.[WAIT 30] And I'd suppose these two feel the same.[WAIT 30] That was a grand battle altogether,[WAIT 30] and I hope we can do it again sometime!
Nita: What's the situation, then? I don't see[WAIT 30] why I need to care about that sort of thing![WAIT 30] All a battle has to be is cracking good fun![WAIT 30] Besides that, my real specialty is Single Battle[WAIT 30] and has been since year dot![WAIT 30] Who cares a fig about being in sync?[WAIT 30] As for you two, I hope I'll see each of you[WAIT 30] in a Single Battle sometime!
What kind of Pokémon will you be battling with? Hurry up and show me already, would you?
Well, I lost the battle, but at least I got to see some amazing Pokémon. That's fine by me!
I sure hope you'll bring a bit more impressive Pokémon along for our next battle, OK?
Whoa! What kind of luck is this? How did I get stuck battling someone so strong off the bat?!
Argh! I've lost! I couldn't do a thing against you!
I...won? Hah hah! Take that! I'm pretty good myself, huh?
My Pokémon are my friends! Take this! It's the power of our friendship!
My friends tried their best, but we were still no competition for you and your team!
Did you see that?! That's the power of our friendship all right!
I came here because I wanted to take part in a fiery Pokémon battle of passion!
That was exactly the kind of battle that I came here for! Thanks for showing me a good time!
Hmm. I really wanted to experience something more climactic than that. Guess that battle was a dud.
All right! Here I go! I'm going to battle you with the same old strategy I always use!
You have some amazing strategies yourself! I've learned a lot from this battle!
It went just as it always does! Hahaha! Looks like I win again!
I'd rather battle Pokémon than sleep! I'd even rather battle than eat! So come on already!
That's it! That's exactly the kind of battle I love! Yup, that's what battling you made me feel like.
Come on, pal! Do me a favor and bring some stronger Pokémon along next time, won't you?
You look like you could do some decent battling yourself! Hah, this is beginning to look promising!
That was a fantastic attack there! Let's battle one another again someday!
That was no poor show you gave! Come challenge me again someday, won't you?
Hahaha! Come battle against me, my Pokémon, and my blindingly beautiful smile!
Hmph... Well, your Pokémon was rather charming as well, wasn't it? Though not as much as me!
My charming Pokémon gave its all for that battle against you! And all for me!
Let's go all out, but fight fairly!
Thank you very much for battling me squarely!
It seems our side was just a little bit stronger.
Be shocked by the strength of my Pokémon! Tremble before us!
I was shocked by the strength of your Pokémon! I trembled before them!
You have learned the strength of my Pokémon! It's sunk right in!
I brought all kinds of Pokémon. ♪ Let's play a lot!
I lost—but thank you! It was so much fun!
I wanted to play more! It ended too soon!
My Pokémon are unbeatable! They won't lose!
Why?! My unbeatable Pokémon...
Amazing, aren't they? My unbeatable Pokémon!
I'll win the tournament with the Pokémon that I have worked so hard to get!
What? Why did this Pokémon lose?!
Yes! I knew it. This Pokémon really is the strongest!
If you get scared, it's OK to run. Don't push yourself. Just surrender!
Whoa! Please wait! You... You've got me.
Tee hee! I showed you the difference between your abilities and mine!
Hmm... I wonder what kind of strategy you're going to use.
I just couldn't read your attack at all...
Your strategies clearly need work!
I'll send you flying with my extraordinary attack!
Eek! You sent my Pokémon flying!
Hee hee! You won't beat me unless you train your Pokémon even harder!
My thought-out strategy is my biggest weapon!
What? You outsmarted me?! What a clever Trainer!
You fell for my tricks! This is how I battle!
Watch this! These are my best partner Pokémon!
Ha ha ha... There's always someone better...
Is that all you've got? You'll never be able to beat my partners like that!
My heart always races out of control before a Pokémon battle!
Thank you for making my heart pound so!
There's nothing that lifts my heart like the nice taste of victory!
I hope that my Pokémon battle with you will become a wonderful memory!
This bitter memory of defeat... I won't ever forget it!
This battle against you will be a memory that I'll treasure!
I'll show you what it takes to be a world champion!
If you've managed to beat me, then that makes you the strongest Trainer in the world!
Now do you understand what it means to be the strongest in the world?
How about I show you the strength that won at Pokémon World Championships?
If you beat me, that means that you're strong enough to win the Pokémon World Championships!
Now do you understand the strength you'd face if you went to the Pokémon World Championships?
Even a Pokémon World Champion like me gets nervous before battles, you know!
What a strong opponent... This is what makes battling so much fun, though!
It looks like my careful battling strategies still won out in the end!
Even a Pokémon World Champion like me gets nervous before battles, you know!
What a strong opponent... This is what makes battling so much fun, though!
It looks like my careful battling strategies still won out in the end!
Watch out! I'm going to show you what a runner-up from the Pokémon World Championships can do!
To beat me, the second strongest Trainer in the world...!
Did you think that being number two in the world would make me a pushover? Think again!
Watch out! I'm going to show you what a runner-up from the Pokémon World Championships can do!
To beat me, the second strongest Trainer in the world...!
Did you think that being number two in the world would make me a pushover? Think again!
I'll take you on in battle, even though I did place second at the Pokémon World Championships!
So there are still even stronger Trainers out in the wide world!
Did you get to feel it? The power of a second-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships?
I'll take you on in battle, even though I did place second at the Pokémon World Championships!
So, there are still even stronger Trainers out in the wide world!
Did you get to feel it? The power of a second-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships?
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships?
You've got the kind of strength that will take you wherever you want in the world!
That's right! I won't be defeated that easily!
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships?
You've got the kind of strength that will take you wherever you want in the world!
That's right! I won't be defeated that easily!
Haven't you ever thought that you'd like to know how strong a third-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships is?
To lose in a battle where I was being serious! You're strong enough to face the world's best!
It looks like I came out on top—not just in luck, but in real strength, too!
Haven't you ever thought that you'd like to know how strong a third-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships is?
To lose in a battle where I was being serious! You're strong enough to face the world's best!
It looks like I came out on top—not just in luck, but in real strength, too!
Watch out, you young fool! I'll be your opponent today!
Ho-how could I lose... Ooohhh! It's just so frustrating!
Gwa-ha-ha-ha! You're about 10 years early if you think you can take me on!
OK, here we go! Let's battle!
Wow, you're really amazing! You must really love your Pokémon, right?
Pretty pretty please! Give me that victory!
I don't want to lose anymore! Never, ever again!
What is this?! Ahhhhh! I'm sorry, my Pokémon!
I'm over the moon!!!
This is a team made for winning! They say that honest effort will never betray you!
What... Is this for real?
I'm the one who's beaten everyone in the nation!
I don't really know what you want from me, but I just have to battle a bit, right?
There's, like, no way I could have won against such a strong opponent. That's crazy.
Huh? I won? What did I do? What happened? I don't get it. Can you explain?
I'm always serious and ready to go! I'm going to go all out again today!
WHAT?! Are you serious?! I stayed up all night thinking of that strategy!
See! Everything went just as I expected it to! My calculations were flawless!
C'mon! C'mon! Faster! Let's go! My Pokémon are chomping at the bit!
What a world! You're amazing! Be my friend, why don't you?!
I get to fight everyone in the world! I love it! This is what living's for, pal!
The word that can unite people around the world... That word is “Pokémon”!
Battles all come down to the luck of a moment! You're amazing for having that luck on your side!
You've got to smile whether you win or lose! That's what it means to be with “Pokémon”!
It doesn't matter who your opponent is. All you need is the appropriate method, and you will win.
Even with the ideal method, I could not win... Your team is nothing short of amazing.
In any pursuit in life, you must fix your eyes on your desired outcome and proceed accordingly.
Aha! Even half-hearted moves are enough to befuddle an opponent!
Aha! A truly strong opponent will not be led astray by such moves!
Aha! You seem to have confused yourself in your effort to befuddle your opponent.
These competitions are like a wild party, right? You never know what will come at you!
Your battling style is not bad! Your Pokémon seemed to have fun, too!
I was just having a good time, but I accidentally went and won. Sorry about that!
What I want is the glory of victory! I'm going wrest it away with all my might!
I'm frustrated with all my might! I'm not going to forget you!
It was what I wanted with all my might! That's why I could seize victory for myself!
I only use the coolest moves! 'Cause I want to win while looking cool!
I guess that just plain winning is cooler than even the coolest moves...
Any moves will look cool when we're the ones using them! Hah!
Every meeting in life is precious, every encounter to be cherished. Let's make our Pokémon happy!
I must use this defeat as fuel for my improvement and grow stronger. Let's meet again!
Win or lose, each battle is a unique experience that only comes once in life. I'm glad we got to battle.

All right! Let's go!
Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo! I did it! I won again!
No! I lost!
Haw haw haw... I'll show you how hawesome my Pokémon are!
What do you think?! Hawesome, huh? My Pokémon and I are the strongest!
Could it be... How... My Pokémon and I are the strongest, though...
No need to waste time saying hello. Bring it on whenever you're ready!
What a match! I'm quite satisfied with the result.
I won't lose next time! Let's battle again sometime!
I've raised my Pokémon with great care. You're not allowed to hurt them!
Yay! Yay! I won! My Pokémon and I are amazing, huh?!
Your Pokémon are more amazing! Trade with me!
I'll show you the ropes of how to really use Pokémon!
I guess we can stop training for today. You learned some new things, right?
You actually taught me a lesson! You're pretty amazing!
You're only young once. And you only get one shot at a given battle. Soon, you'll be nothing but a memory.
A bit more color has been added to a page of my youthful memories...
I don't need memories like this. Deleting memory...
School is boring. I've got nothing to do. Yawn. I'm only battling to kill the time.
Am I supposed to be all, like, “Yay!” when I win? It's too late to get excited now.
I'm actually getting tired of battling... There's gotta be something new to do...
I'm a beginner, but I'll do my best! I'll give it everything I can. Watch me!
Oh! I forgot to finish off our battle! I still need to study more...
Sorry if I bored you! I'll try harder next time!
I'm gaining as much experience as I can because I want to be a Gym Leader someday.
That was quite an experience. The data I got from you will help me grow stronger.
Even difficult, trying experiences have their purpose, I suppose.
Hey! This is no laughing matter! We're about to battle!
Regardless of who wins or loses, we should thank each other after a battle.
Regardless of who wins or loses, we should thank each other after a battle.
I'll give you a battle worthy of a battle-school valedictorian!
Now do you understand the ability of someone who's at the head of the class?
Wh-where do you study? I want to study there, too!
My dad is a Veteran Trainer, so I should have what it takes, too.
I guess the talent you're born with really does decide battles...
This result is impossible... I am my father's son, after all.
I'm good at the strategy and tactics of battles, but I'm bad at throwing Poké Balls!
I was able to throw my Poké Ball this time! It usually just rolls out of my hand...
If only there were a machine that would throw Poké Balls for me...
I'm honestly not that good at Pokémon battles... When I think about my future, though, it seems like I have no choice but to battle!
I hate to say this, but if you can't even beat me, the rest of the way is going to be really tough.
See... I knew I couldn't win. I'm not cut out for competition.
Experience begets power! Isn't that what they say?! Anyway, won't you battle me?
Even an amateur like me can win! Experience is the best teacher, so they say.
This battle was a valuable experience. I still need to gain more experience!
There's a limit to how far I could get studying by myself, so I started taking battle lessons.
It seems that my studies have paid off. Could this be my actual ability level?
All I learn in my lessons is the conventional way of battling, which doesn't seem useful in actual battles.
This is Rough Skin, isn't it?! Rain Dish, Rain Dish?
It's not Rough Skin! Rain Dish, Rain Dish.
This is Rough Skin, isn't it?! Rain Dish, Rain Dish...
Huehuehue... If it's cash you want, I've got some. How about you go and lose this battle for me?
I may have said I had cash, but I haven't said anything about giving you any!
I couldn't fool you, could I? You do quite well, don't you?
I shall present to you elegant moves worthy of the title of Rich Boy!
It's said that a Pokémon's strength depends on its training. It's not your fault. It can't be helped.
To think that anybody could be stronger than me! ...You're not just anybody!
My father, a great man, always said, “The ends justify the means as long as you win!”
It's just as my father said... History is written by the winners.
Wh-why?! Could my father's words have been wrong?
Just because I'm Daddy's little girl, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm ladylike!
I do what I want! I live how I please! That's the way Daddy's little girl rolls!
That strength... You're like a thriving roadside weed...
Chosen Trainers will choose chosen Pokémon.
So it seems victory has chosen me.
It seems I have been chosen to lose...
There's a certain etiquette to battles with glamorous, elegant ladies.
Fool! Oh no, there I go again...
Such an immodest way of battling! I just can't be around it!
You look so serious and boring... Can you keep me entertained?
Hey, we just got going! This is where it starts getting good!
Ah... You weren't bad... Which only makes me miserable...
I may be incompetent, having been born only recently, but I'll take the liberty of battling you as best I can.
You graciously allowed a win to someone so inexperienced that I still have my baby teeth. I thank you!
Thank you so very much for spending time with a novice like me, still so young I wet the bed.
Oh! Yer a bad guy, aren't ya? I'll stand up to ya!
Wahaha! Justice wins! I'm gonna exile you!
You didn't let up at all, even against a little kid! Yer a bad guy, just like I said!
Hey, baby! You're just what I've been looking for! I'm not gonna let you get away!
Hey, don't think bad of me, baby! You ran out of luck when you met me.
I guess I slipped up there... You did pretty good, baby.
My Pokémon and I are the strongest. We'll take care of each and every one of you.
My Pokémon and I were the strongest. We took care of each and every one of you.
My Pokémon and I are the strongest, so there's no way we could have truly lost.
Um, this is what you call a battle, right? Why do we do stuff like this again?
Um, that was what you call a battle, right? You lost, so now you have to be my servant!
Umm, that was what you call a battle, right? I lost, so now do I have to be your servant?
I'm the heroine of justice! You mysterious, evil person! I'll drive you away!
Huh? I went to the trouble of taking you down, but you didn't explode like on TV!
Whoa! The world is falling into the hands of evil! Are we headed for an unhappy ending?
Snicker snicker...
Snicker snicker!
Sniffle sniffle...
I know you, Trainer! So you're the Champion, eh?
I beat the Champion, so I'm the new Champion!
Whoa! That's what I expected from the Champion! Strong!
I've spent 20 years trying to find myself... But where am I?
Before I start searching for my real self... Where in the world are we here?
Wait up a second! Hey! Don't you know who I am?
How many thousands of years has it been... If only I could lose, my journey would end...
I won again... My journey still isn't over...
You... Thank you... Now my journey can come to an end...
Hey, don't be so stuck up! Battles can be left up to fate!
Winning, losing—in the end, it's all luck. But if it's fun, isn't that enough?
Oh! Aren't you the lucky one! I hope you also had fun, though.
Travels! Encounters! Love and adventure! Well, where will I find a darling to share it?
I'm not looking for a kid! Tell me where the hunky men are!
Sniff, sniff... This is no good... I can't smell the perfume of love. Bye!
I knew this cheap package tour wouldn't be any good.
This tour's supposed to come with Pokémon battles, but it's just making me tired!
Why would this place be included in the tour?
You know, the prices in this region really are low, aren't they?
Though the level of Trainers in this region... Well, they're not worth writing home about.
I could live the high life in a country where everything costs so little!
My job is riding on the result of this battle.
I did it again. I won... I'm going to be fired for not providing good-enough service...
That was close... I just barely lost... Thanks to the service I provided, I can keep my job.
I've got no time for greetings! Food! Give me food, I say!
Hey... You lost, right? Give me food... Give it to me...
I...wanted to eat...until I'm stuffed... one...last...time...
Welcome! Welcome! Pokémon Trainers, right this way!
We truly thank you for your patronage. Please do come again.
We have reached closing time for today. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
Ain't you dat Champion? Lessee what you got!
Hohoho. Dat's it, huh? Even the Champion ain't nothin' special.
I guess you could say I expected this, or— how shall I put it—you gave me a wicked match.
I have confidence in my Pokémon's manners.
We're competing to see who wins and who loses, so of course we have manners.
I was so focused on manners that I overlooked a chance to win.
Welcome!
Thank you!
Please come again!
I'm begging for more allowance and saving my money so I can go on a trip around the world someday!
I turn 44 this year, but I have no intention of going out into the world until I've gone around the world.
When I said that the world was calling me, my mom told me to get a job.
I can't let Pokémon I really love battle.
My Pokémon could get hurt, so I can't take them out here.
The Pokémon you use... Do you really like them?
The Pokémon Fan Club is a secret organization into which only a chosen few may enter.
You don't meet the prerequisites for admission. First, I recommend that you get stronger.
You're actually good, aren't you? Join the Pokémon Fan Club!
My husband may not be much to look at, but his love of Pokémon is what drew me to him.
The most important thing in a marriage is having shared interests, after all.
Looks fade with age anyway. It's best to have the same values.
Sometimes I drive myself crazy wondering why I wasn't born a Pokémon.
I wonder if I could become a Pokémon if I had a Trainer...
Oh, I wish I could crawl inside a Poké Ball to live! Ooh, I want to be ordered what moves to do!
I'm drowning in Pokémon. It might be too late for me.
I think life's OK as long as you get back more than you lose.
Even my own family disowned me. As long as I have Pokémon, that's OK, though.
I inherited this big-boned body from my parents... I'm like a living mountain range...
Ha ha! Now I can consume some more calories...
It's not enough... It's never enough. My bad cholesterol isn't high enough...
I was born, raised, and live in the mountains. I'm an Ace Hiker, I tells ya.
You're no good at all, I tell ya! Wanna hide away in the mountains with me?
They say perseverance can move mountains. I won't give up yet, I tells ya!
Muwahaha! The legend of my invincibility begins with you!
I'm completely invincible! My legend begins here!
Ha... Are you telling me that your legend just started?
Wait! Wait! I'm still trying to think up my strategy!
I had no plan, but I won anyway! Maybe I shouldn't overthink things!
I told you to wait a second! It's just that my strategy wasn't ready yet!
I can hear a fairy's voice... It's telling me not to slip up with you...
Thank you, fairy... I was about to be in trouble...
Fairy... I'm scared... Help... Help me...
Uhnn... What is this place? It doesn't have the aroma of a fairy tale at all!
No, no, that won't do, it won't do at all. When I'm in trouble, I feel farther away from fairy tales.
I need to get out of this place. My fairy tale is going to disappear!
...Stay away.
...Go away.
...Bye.
As you can see, I'm a bad guy, and that's why I fight dirty!
You're too soft to face off against a bad guy! You're making things harder on yourself.
OK, OK. All right, all right. Justice has to win in the end.
Huhuehuehue... No crying when you lose...
Hey, hey! No crying! I've got no time for some kid's tears!
Sniffle... Sniffle sniffle... I'm disappointed... So disappointed...
I have a strict policy about my hairstyle. It's my whole life, so I get really fired up about it.
When my hairstyle is looking really sharp, it gets me really fired up!
I'm having a bad hair day, so there's nothing I could've done.
I hope the distance between us gets a little closer during this battle.
Your fickle tenderness is piercing my heart.
Our feelings for each other are so strong that the loneliness will be terrible after we say good-bye.
Fair and square? Don't make me laugh! There's no point to battles if you don't win!
Victory is what makes battling worth it. What what?! I just dropped knowledge!
What can you learn from a defeat? All you feel is regret, right?
Br-bring it on! Bearing in mind that I'm a b-beginner!
Yay! Thanks for going easy on me!
Hey! Are you for real? I'll pay you back for treating me like this!
Defeat is not a dish on my bill of fare!
Oh dear! You aren't quite fresh enough, are you? Not even fit for a mess hall!
Oh, there's a kick to you! You must tell me your secret ingredient!
St-stay away from me! Get too close, and I will julienne you!
It...it...it's all your fault for challenging me! Next time I'll turn you into a tasty stew!
Stop! Just hold on a moment! I don't want to be grilled over a flame!
Ahh... I'm starving... I'm too weak to even throw a Poké Ball...
I'm glad I won, but I can't move another inch... Somebody... Get me some food...
I just...wanted to... stuff myself...one...last...time.
People say I'm a diamond in the rough. Sure you wanna battle with me?
I don't know what they mean, but people say I'm a diamond in the rough!
There's something about the phrase “diamond in the rough” that makes me hungry.
First comes practice. Second comes slacking off. Third and fourth come panic and more panic. Fifth comes battle...
Apparently, hard work will never let you down. Couldn't it be enough to work kind of hard?
OK, OK... I lose. Maybe I'll just keep working kind of hard.
Th-this is my first real battle... M-my legs feel weak...
I can't remember what orders I gave... B-but I won!
My mind is a blank. I can't hold a thought in my head right now.
Just because I'm a Rising Star, don't expect the freshness of a newcomer.
That was beginner's luck, if I do say so myself.
I may be a newcomer and a Rising Star, but I'm already 39.
I slipped past my master to come play here in secret.
I deceived my master by saying I was running errands and came here to play.
My master hates both Pokémon and battles, so there's no other way for me to come here.
Very well then, I shall take the liberty of determining whether or not you possess the qualifications befitting a master.
It seems that your power is slightly insufficient to employ me.
How wonderful! Won't you hire me? I do command quite a salary, though.
I've been searching for a master I can serve for 10 years. I'm a wandering Butler...
O master, where art thou... Perhaps I should lower my standards...
Being a meddlesome old man won't keep me fed. Isn't there a master out there for me?
I started this job because it pays well, but I've just about reached my limit!
Pokémon are good at doing what they're told. Me? I absolutely can't stand being ordered around.
Being bossed around is crazy annoying, right? That's one area where Pokémon are really great.
When you're dressed like this and say cute things, you're pretty popular with lonely guys.
Lonely guys are easy to be around. You never have to be yourself with them.
The problem is when I'm dressed like this, the man of my dreams gets weirded out and pulls away from me.
Are you supposed to be my new overlord? What! Is this really OK?!
What? Are you through already? As an overlord, you're totally not worth serving.
I expected nothing less from my overlord! It would be worthwhile to serve you!
My Pokémon will trump yours! You can bet on losing!
All right! Victory is mine! Fortune is smiling on me!
Ahh... I'm flat broke... That's it. I've got nothing left...
My paintbrush is made of secret materials.
Well, pull out a strand of your hair. I need it to make my paintbrush thicker again.
Hmmph... I won't tell you the secret of my paintbrush.
You've got potential! All right! I'll make you my apprentice!
I feel great! The best! Just like that! Listen to me worshipfully!
I don't care for your disobedient attitude! Consider yourself expelled from your apprenticeship!
A battle with me is a test of your aesthetic sensibility.
Hunnh... Not bad... You've got a surreal side...
Hunnh... Not bad... You've got a realistic side...
People have started calling me an up-and-coming artist, but it's not all it's cracked up to be.
I thought I could make money if I just bought some paper and some paint...
There's these people called curators who take most of my money, so it's like I'm not making any money.
Release it now! Release the passion locked inside you!
Is that all you've got? Is that the sum total of the passion you have locked inside you?
Ahh... That's the kind of passion I've been looking for!
It bothers me that people always misunderstand me. I'm a lot more pure than everyone thinks.
My body and mind aren't necessarily always in sync.
I really don't want my skin to burn, so I want to stay in the shade while I work.
You'd best not send out any weak Pokémon! Your opponent is my partner in construction!
Gwahahaha! How about that?! Didja see that?! My partner's rough and tough!
Ahh... My partner broke down. What am I gonna do at the site tomorrow?
I can't spend all of my time battling with Pokémon, or I could lose my job!
Even now, as long as I keep coming here, I'm missing out on other things.
It's not like I regret it or anything. A life where you can go crazy about something is a happy life.
There aren't as many people battling at work these days because they've moved on to the Contest Spectacular.
The Contest Spectacular is just superficial. It's just not in my nature at all.
I'm tired of losing battles. Maybe I'll try going to the Contest Spectacular...
What I really want to do is surf. But I can't swim, so I got these Roller Skates.
No matter how good I get on these Roller Skates, I still don't feel like I'm any more popular with the ladies.
I bet guys who can surf get more girls than guys on Roller Skates. I wish I could surf...
People call me the “electrastic” Trainer! Think you can keep up with me?
That speed! It's electrastic!
Apparently electrastic isn't a real word. I'll keep using it because it's cool, though.
I'm only good on Roller Skates. I can't skateboard or snowboard at all.
I would never just skate by in battle! Even if I am wearing Roller Skates!
I guess I can't just skate by anymore... Even if I am wearing Roller Skates.
Lots of the metal fixtures on my skates broke, and I've been stuck wearing them for close to four years now.
My Roller Skates have become like a part of my body now.
Won't they stink since they've been on my feet this whole time? I even wear them in the bath!
Hey! If you're not considerate to your elders, you'll be pulled out by the roots!
I'll bet that turned your hair white!
The fruits of my victory... have already been harvested...
Hey there! I'm a Gardener! My scissors are my only real friends.
My specialty and my hobby are both cutting things! My favorite move with scissors is Guillotine!
I knew I hated humans! All I need is scissors!
If all you have is passable ingredients, you can't do better than passable battles.
You haven't drawn out the natural flavors of your Pokémon.
I have no idea what the natural flavors of my Pokémon are.
Adults don't say what they're really thinking, OK? You have to read between the lines to find the truth.
Uh-oh! You're OK, aren't you? Sorry I flew into a rage!
Well done! You were lovely! I can't imitate that!
There are no Trainers who know my techniques but can't cook!
Hahaha! Thanks for the nourishment! That was a pretty tasty encounter!
What sort of Trainer is this... That flavor is too peculiar to eat...
Even as old as I am, I just can't give up Pokémon battles.
What would my life have been like without Pokémon?
You have to be careful! Pokémon battles can steal away so much of your time...
Isn't that nice... You're still a kid... I wish I could go back...
I've become a cynical adult, so I even cheat during battles.
I was so innocent back then... Where has that girl gone?
I've always wanted to be a Beauty, so I've made a fresh start, focusing on my appearance.
Whatever your dream is, if you want to make it a reality, you have to do what it takes.
Six months' investment in the latest treatments... Look at me now! I glow like never before!
My trip starts here! I'll beat you and get a ticket!
All right! I'm on my way now! My battle begins here!
The train called victory has left without me... My trip ends here...
What's that? I look bored? That's because this is a company trip.
I really can't take sleeping all huddled together with my coworkers in a big room.
Don't you think it's better to take trips alone or with someone you love or something!
Traveling alone... Isn't it great to be so free...
I'm traveling alone, so it's fun not needing to worry about anyone else...
Traveling alone is the best... After all, I'm all alone...
Traveling is fun, but thinking about what souvenirs to buy is a hassle.
I mean, it costs money, so I wish the custom of giving souvenirs would go away.
It's not like anybody is ever really happy to get souvenirs from people anyway.
A true Gentleman's heart never wavers in battle.
Ha... Snicker snicker... I can't...stop laughing...
Ooh... Ooh... I can't...stop crying...
I'd like to have a pleasant battle! Provide me with that service!
Taking it easy on me isn't very good service! You have no idea how to entertain!
Yes yes! That was a nice battle! It feels good to lose like that!
Don't be nervous—leave it to me. If it's technique we're talking about, I'm confident.
How was it? It was fun, right? I knew my technique would win out!
For my Pokémon to not even stand a chance, you must be quite the technician!
For the sake of your future, think about how you interact with your elders.
You know how to make your way in the world. I think you'll succeed in the future.
You don't know anything about the world. I think you'll struggle in the future.
Even though my upbringing and behavior are poor, I've raised my Pokémon well.
Right? Pretty good Pokémon, huh? I'm suited to raising things.
Unlike my diabolical self, these are some good Pokémon.
You get as much love as you give when you're dealing with Pokémon...
Pokémon...are nice... They may be selfish, but they won't betray you.
The only thing I still believe in... is my Pokémon...
Unlike humans, Pokémon never betray you. That's why I decided to love them.
This proves my Pokémon have accepted my love.
I am happy! Happy, I tell you! Don't look at me like that!
There's a lot that goes into being a Pokémon Breeder.
The most fun part of this job is getting close to Pokémon.
The hardest part of this job is saying farewell to Pokémon.

Hello-how-are-ya? In good form? I'm Nita. Welcome to me Battle Maison, pet. I've not been to Hoenn in ages! Sure, I may be the youngest of us four Battle Chatelaine sisters, but I'm still a class Trainer. I've been an owner of this Battle Maison this long time. Honestly, I am not telling fibs! I'd be in charge of the Single Battles myself. Would you do me a favor? A bit of a match? You will? Grand! Then let's begin at once!
Would you look at the cut of me Pokémon! What a battle, and me not trying for real even! Oh, I'm scarlet for you, pet. Made a complete and utter hash o' that one, didn't you now? But get you a bit more training, and you'll be grand. Trust me, training's your only man. The Battle Maison and Nita are both here and waiting for a challenge every day o' the year! We'll always be waiting for you! See you then!
That was great fun! En't you a jammie one! But then I know what you're on about, I do! Ye weren't really trying, then. Is it not yourself who is Hoenn Champion? Should we meet again, I'll be giving it me all! If you want to battle against me serious, you wouldn't be goin' astray to train up a bit. Thanks a mill! You come back again sometime!
Ummmm... W-welcome to the Battle Maison... My name is Evelyn... I'll t-try t-t-to serve you as a Battle Chatelaine like my sisters, so... I'm the th-third of us four. M-my specialty is... Double Battles... I guess... Ummmm... I've not been to Hoenn for a while, so I'm a bit more nervous than usual... Oh, please! I'm sorry, but... Please s-start the battle already!
I'm s-s-so sorry! I didn't m-mean for anything like this to... It wasn't supposed to happen like this! Being back here in my hometown, I su-su-suppose I got overly excited. I'm supposed to make sure that our fine guests have a grand time! Sniffle... Sniffle... Sob... I'm so sorry... I'll be certain to do it right next time... So please... Please come to challenge me to a Double Battle again...
O-oh! Fair play! You're quite strong, aren't you, guest! Now that I've seen how strong you are, I feel I shouldn't have held back. It's just that my elder sisters had asked me to take it a bit easy on new guests... The next time that we battle, I will try much harder to beat you! P-please continue to patronize the Battle Maison... And to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'm Dana. Thank you for coming. I am the second eldest of the four sisters who run this Battle Maison. I am also a Triple Battle expert! ...I've no use for an act like that here in Hoenn, have I? Everyone here knows my true self! Well, give us a battle, then! I'll show you how it's done!
Hang on, are you not the Champion, then? Is that all you've got? Catch yourself on! I suppose it can't be helped if you're feelin' a bit off today... Come back for more if you're disappointed. I'll be waiting.
Gasp...gasp... I expected no less from the Champion... You and your Pokémon are brilliant, aren't ye? You've lit a fire in me heart, you have... Gasp gasp... You're all right... Away ye go and keep on winning! 'Cause if ye do... I'll show ye my real skills. Ye'd do well to mind yourself then!
If you're free for a time, come on by. ♪ If you're bored for a while, stop on in. ♪ Battle till you burst, oh, won't you try. ♪ Want to battle? The Battle Maison Replica's fine. ♪ Heh heh! What do you think, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0C06)]my ladyoung missie? We just had that jingle written for our wee Battle Maison Replica. Music can be a lovely distraction. D'you not find that yourself? Oh me, I've not even introduced myself, have I? Well, don't bite my head off! I'm the eldest of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters. Do call me Morgan. We all thank you for coming to visit our cherished Battle Maison Replica today. I'll do me best to entertain here at the birthplace of the Battle Maison.
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? Here in Hoenn is where our Battle Maison was born—and me sisters and I, as well. These days we make more over in Kalos, so this is no more than a replica now. I'll be taking me leave, but I look forward to your next visit.
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? Get out of the garden! I'd no idea you were such a fine Trainer! I should expect no less from Hoenn's Champion, I suppose. I've taken quite a shine to you, my fine [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]ladgirl! Sad to say, we've quite run out of time for our battle today. I wait with all my heart for the next time you come to challenge me!
Thanks for coming to the Battle Maison![WAIT 30] I'm Dana.[WAIT 30] I am the second eldest of the four sisters who run[WAIT 30] this Battle Maison.[WAIT 30] I will praise your bravery, at least, in attempting[WAIT 30] a Multi Battle with me![WAIT 30] And, of course, I am hardly alone![WAIT 30] ...[WAIT 30] Oh, give me a break, Evelyn![WAIT 30] It's your line next! Come on!
Dana: Well, I suppose that wasn't so bad then...[WAIT 30] You can't stack up to the skills of us sisters, though![WAIT 30] Isn't that so, Evelyn?[WAIT 30] ...[WAIT 30] ...[WAIT 30] Oh, for pity's sake, Evelyn! Wake up![WAIT 30] I'm morto for them and you! Honest!
Dana: Ugh...[WAIT 30] You're not bad, that's for certain...[WAIT 30] To think that you would be able to break through[WAIT 30] our perfect combo...[WAIT 30] But my real stage is the Triple Battle![WAIT 30] And Evelyn's speciality is Double Battle![WAIT 30] If you took either of us on in our own specialties,[WAIT 30] we'd never lose to you![WAIT 30] Isn't that right, Evelyn?!
I-I-I'm sorry, Dana...[WAIT 30] U-um, my name is Evelyn...[WAIT 30] I-I-I'm usually in charge of Double Battles...[WAIT 30] ...[WAIT 30] U-um...so...well...[WAIT 30] I'm not all flash like my sister Dana when it comes[WAIT 30] to talking...[WAIT 30] ...[WAIT 30] U-umm! Please! I'm sorry, but...[WAIT 30] Please start the battle already!
Evelyn: Huh? Wh-what?[WAIT 30] D-did you say something, Dana?[WAIT 30] I was so n-nervous...that I don't remember[WAIT 30] a thing o' the battle.[WAIT 30] Sniff...sniffle...[WAIT 30] Oh, I am scarlet for myself...[WAIT 30] Ummmm...I... I... I...[WAIT 30] Th-thank you for the battle![WAIT 30] P-please visit the Battle Maison again![WAIT 30] N-now...excuse me!
Evelyn: Wh-wha... Well, I never said...[WAIT 30] I-I don't really think I'm all that good at[WAIT 30] Double Battles either...[WAIT 30] The r-reason we just lost was because[WAIT 30] I'm so slow...[WAIT 30] S-so I don't think these guests should[WAIT 30] expect much from me...[WAIT 30] I'd look right silly... Please...[WAIT 30] Pick anything but Double Battle...[WAIT 30] N-now then... I'll excuse myself...[WAIT 30] Thank you for the battle...
W-w-welcome...[WAIT 30] To the B-Battle Maison...[WAIT 30] Uh um...[WAIT 30] We would like to thank you...for choosing[WAIT 30] a Multi Battle today...[WAIT 30] S-so...um...[WAIT 30] You will be facing my elder sister Morgan[WAIT 30] and me, Evelyn, today...[WAIT 30]
Evelyn: Th-th-thank you very much![WAIT 30] Y-your Pokémon were brilliant![WAIT 30] I w-will also work hard, so you'll never be stuck![WAIT 30] for a challenge...[WAIT 30] So please...[WAIT 30] Come visit us at the Battle Maison again...
Evelyn: Um, fair play, you two![WAIT 30] You were both so very strong![WAIT 30] Th-the truth is I was nervous facing two strangers[WAIT 30] at the same time.[WAIT 30] So I don't know what I did...[WAIT 30] B-but I will try even harder the next time that we[WAIT 30] have a Multi Battle...[WAIT 30] So please d-do definitely ask me to join you[WAIT 30] in a Multi Battle again.
Evelyn? Are you ready to begin?[WAIT 30] Are you nervous again, pet?[WAIT 30] Remember, it is very important to greet our[WAIT 30] precious guests...[WAIT 30] I know some of these goofs like it when you[WAIT 30] waffle about, so that's fine for business, but...[WAIT 30] Hmm?[WAIT 30] Oh? Oh! Were you earwigging?[WAIT 30] What a cheeky thing you are![WAIT 30] I should not have been discussing[WAIT 30] personal matters in front of a guest![WAIT 30] L-let's just get straight to the battle, shall we?[WAIT 30] And not before time![WAIT 30] Evelyn and myself will do our very best,[WAIT 30] though we're both quite hopeless at all this!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you two![WAIT 30] Did you enjoy our wee little combo?[WAIT 30] I've two other younger sisters, sure, in addition to[WAIT 30] my shy Evelyn here.[WAIT 30] If you happen to meet either of them, I trust they'll[WAIT 30] show you a good time.[WAIT 30] We'll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30] Don't work too hard!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you![WAIT 30] Did you enjoy our little combo?[WAIT 30] Our Evelyn is quite reserved, so she gets a wee bit[WAIT 30] nervous in these big battles.[WAIT 30] But she'd take you on handily in a Double Battle![WAIT 30] I hope you'll claim a Double Battle with her soon.[WAIT 30] And of course I'd be tickled meself to see you in[WAIT 30] one of my Rotation Battles.[WAIT 30] We'll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30] Don't work too hard!
The battles continue forever! Welcome to the world with no end!
If you're already losing, maybe it'd be better to turn back now.
Ahaha! There it is! That's right! You're already right at home in this world!
Victory will never come to those who aren't prepared to face defeat.
I'm not prepared to lose, but I won easily anyway.
Keep winning for me, too. Become the number-one Trainer here.
Miniskirts are, like, unbelievable, right?
They're easy to move in and cute. Anything but a miniskirt would be unbelievable, right?
You've got to enjoy a fad while you still can, right?
Close my eyes... Sharpen my senses... I have to trust my instincts...
I'm glad I trusted my instincts...
My judgment wasn't off, though...
In order to become a first-class Trainer, I was forced to come study abroad here.
I can learn a lot from Pokémon battles in this country.
I'm too homesick to want to do any studying...
My dream is to be rich and live in the lap of luxury.
The reason I'm here battling like this is to try to grab my shot.
When I'm a big, important man, I'll make you regret this.
My Pokémon and I will take the liberty of using you to face off against.
I suppose it could be said that my relationship with my Pokémon is satisfactory for the time being.
I need to rethink my relationship with my Pokémon.
If you slacked off on your studies, you've got no chance. Capable girls like me are capable.
If you waste all of your time, you'll never grow as a Trainer.
When you lose, do you go so far as to analyze the reason for your defeat and review your performance?
I've already got most of the Pokémon and more money than I know what to do with.
I just win all my Pokémon battles, too. I feel like my life is already over.
I'm so well off that life has become tedious. Even experiences like this are fun for me.
Hey, hey! I'm a Rich Boy! Bow to your patron!
Now you understand, eh? Don't be so impudent as to think you could defeat me!
Hey! How dare you do such a thing to a Rich Boy like me!
My family thinks battles are beneath me, but I can't help but enjoy them.
Gwahaha... I can't get enough of the feeling of superiority when looking down on a loser...
Uhhn... I can't get enough of the feeling of loss when the winner looks disdainfully at me...
I was born rich and I party all the time. I'm what you call party people.
Battles are way more exciting than any party.
Ahh... I want to have an all-night Pokémon-battle party!
My dad catches Pokémon for me. I don't know how strong they are, though.
My Pokémon and I ARE strong! Thank you, Dad!
My Pokémon and I are weak... Stupid Dad!
My big brother who never comes out of his room told me to come check this place out for him.
I'll let my big brother know that this is a fun place.
I'll let my big brother know that this is a scary place.
Ma! Pa! Watch me! I'll do my best!
Ma! Pa! Were you watching? I was so strong!
Ma, Pa... I lost... Get revenge for me...
All Mom and Dad do is fiddle with their tablets! They never play with me! I'm bored!
I don't like Mom or Dad or their silly tablets! All I need are Pokémon!
Maybe I'm not really their kid... Maybe their tablets are...
I may be getting on in years, but I'm a self-proclaimed globe-trotting adventurer!
Actually, this trip is just an excuse for me to keep running away from reality.
When adventure comes calling for me, it's bye-bye to my harsh reality!
I'm collecting Poké Balls from all over the world. As long as you're here, let me show you!
What'd you think of my Poké Ball collection? Pokémon don't matter to me!
Well, Poké Balls are actually all the same anywhere you go in the world, though.
I want to go home already... I've had enough of traveling...
Trainers keep attacking me... I shouldn't have come to a place like this...
Places you don't know are scary... Just lounging around the house is the best...
What I look forward to when I travel is catching Pokémon at my destination.
When I'm with the Pokémon I brought home from my travels, it brings back lovely memories of my trip.
Lovely memories from my trip live on forever in my Poké Ball.
Thanks to my Pokémon, I spend every day totally addicted to my part-time job.
I have a gluttonous Pokémon that's destroying my budget. No joke!
Living life for Pokémon... Am I OK with this...
After I finish working at my part-time job, Pokémon battles soak gradually into my tired body.
Yay! Pokémon battles are the best! Battles are what I live for!
Terrible bosses, all the annoyances— I can forget it all while I'm battling.
All right, I'm going to start the timer, so let's get this over with before it goes off!
Hey, wait! That was crazy fast! I guess we can go ahead and stop.
See, see? Time's already up. You were a bit too tough.
My part-time job is so fun that I don't feel like going to school anymore.
It feels like I'm going to waste my youth just going back and forth between here and my part-time job.
I may not be good at studying, but working is really fun for me.
Your opponent will be me, the Pokémon Fan Club's greatest battler!
Soft! You're too soft! You'll never get into the Pokémon Fan Club like that!
Oh... You are quite the fan... You are qualified to join the Pokémon Fan Club...
...Shall we begin? Let's see just how much of a fan you are...
Tsk tsk. That wasn't much of a showing. You're not enough of a fan yet.
Hmmph... I'm no match for you... I can't beat people who are bigger fans than me.
Do you intend to challenge me, a director of the Pokémon Fan Club?
It was a mistake to challenge me if you're not that much of a fan.
Glory...to the... Pokémon...Fan Club...
Well, I've got nothing but time on my hands. You don't look busy. Keep me company!
Well, you helped me kill some time. I'm satisfied with that.
Please don't leave! Things were going so well! I have such great plans for us!
It's not like I'm calling to the mountains. It's the mountains that are calling to me!
A man who is loved by the mountains... Guilty as charged...
I can hear a sobbing voice... The mountains are weeping...
Hi there! I'm a Hiker! ♪ Watch your step!
Yay! The Hiker won! Love and gratitude to my Pokémon! ♪
You made my Pokémon cry! I'm gonna break down and howl, too!
How should I hold my arm when I throw a Poké Ball? Is it like this? Or maybe like this?
Apparently battles go better when you throw your Poké Ball in the right way.
I looked cool throwing my Poké Ball. But I got distracted, so I lost.
A younger friend of mine just became an Ace Trainer...
All right! Can I be one, too? An Ace Trainer...
Everything she knows about Pokémon she learned from me. It's not fair. Why is she an Ace Trainer when I'm not?
Talking...is not...my thing. Let's just battle.
Talking is not my thing, and the battle's over, so I'm going home.
Talking is not my thing. Neither is losing. I'm going home.
My Fairy says to take you out!
My Fairy told me to do it! It's all my Fairy's fault!
My Fairy says that you're crazy dangerous!
If there are still dreams in your heart, then I am still a Fairy Tale Girl.
I've decided to ignore reality. I'm a Fairy Tale Girl, after all.
Quit talking about my age.
Hey! Who you starin' at! You want to scrap? Keep it up and you'll have one.
Whoa... I'm totally on edge... If that had gone on any longer, I would've cried!
Waahhh! You're scary! Stop picking on me!
I know your face. You think you can battle like that?
Does your face still look like that? You won't be doing any winning like that.
No! I'm steaming mad! How could I lose to someone with a face like that?!
In accordance with the rules of unsportsmanship, my pledge is to play dirty and battle unfairly!
I battled my way through unfairly and dirtily! Thank you all so very much!
I'm disappointed! I'm disappointed in myself! I tried to play as dirty as I could!
I chose the path of the Punk Girl. Not being popular is getting to me, though...
Maybe it's bad that I never give halfway strong guys a chance...
Fine... Maybe I'll change my tune from Punk Girl to surfer girl. Now, look out!
I've never done anything wrong in my whole life. Why do you judge me based on my looks?
This outfit is a hand-me-down from my mother that she wore when she was young.
You're awful... Everyone is awful... Why won't people judge me by what's inside?
Hmmph... What's so great about Trainers? You don't battle yourself, but you sure do talk big.
Next time, I wanna battle person versus person, You're just a kid, though, so I'll let you off the hook.
I came here to crush impudent Trainers.
You want to battle with mois? You're gonna be rust in my frying pan!
Did you think you could defeat mois? You're softer than a bag of marshmallows!
How could it have turned out like this? Where did my seasoning go wrong?!
As a result of throwing Poké Balls, we are well trained in how to handle pans.
The only thoughts in my brain are culinary thoughts.
I've been inspired by our battle! I've suddenly thought of a new dish!
“Zere eez no accounting for taste.” Zis saying—do you know eet?
Ze bitterness and ze sourness, zey are also ze important parts of ze flavor, no?
You understand zese words I say to you in ze battle, no?
I just got into a fight with my boss. He made me mad, so now I'm slackin' off!
Oh, this is so irritating! Why don't you understand me?
I'm doing this for my boss's sake. What do you think I am?
I'm tired of serving my boss. You there! Serve me now!
All right! From now on I'm your boss.
Serving people is tough. You can't choose your boss, so it's stressful.
Despite my appearance, I was an Ace Trainer until recently.
Past a certain age, it's time to hang up on being an Ace Trainer and move on.
Ace Trainers past a certain age have all changed their careers.
Oof... My body is weary from doing so much housework, so I'm looking forward to this.
You can't lose yet! You have to entertain me more!
Unnh... Not yet... I can still keep going...
Being a Maid is just a part-time gig. I'm really a Battle Girl!
Oh no... I'm glad I won the battle, but I tore my uniform!
The pay from my part-time job is good, so that's why I'm able to battle like this.
This isn't some kind of cosplay! This is just my style.
Just wearing the fashions that I like gets me excited!
Whoa, that was a close one. I almost got my clothes dirty.
I say it's art, but really I just want to make easy money.
I can have lazy battles like this, but I can't hold down a square job.
My way of doing things is to put ridiculous prices on my shoddy paintings.
Aha, your confidence shows. You must have good Pokémon.
Your overconfidence is your weakness. Wasn't that an unexpected result for you?
I get it. You have nothing but good Pokémon.
My 88 years of living have led me to this conclusion: Victory shall be my only art!
And so I have produced another great work!
Give me back those 88 years! Give me back my art!
I come here when I'm low in inspiration, hoping to find ideas for new creations.
Your disappointed face pleases me. It stirs my creative impulses...
Your triumphant face pleases me. It stirs my creative impulses...
Before we waste our time on idle chat, please show me your skills.
Umm-hmmm... Thanks. If that's all you got, then never mind.
What excellent Pokémon you have! Please become my model!
I like how you look. I could paint your portrait.
Oh! What a great expression you're showing! Being crushed by defeat makes you more worth painting!
That battle itself was art, but can't you make more out of your winning pose?
Well, I'm going to do things my way, so feel free to battle however you like.
In the end, you have to go at your own pace. You can't help but be influenced by others.
There's something nice and comfortable about the pace you and your Pokémon keep to.
I'm what you call a professional punching bag. I work here to earn a living.
I tried to lose on purpose to make you feel good... This is no good. I'm definitely getting fired for this...
I'm a professional punching bag, so all that matters is that you're pleased with your victory.
I'm happy that I'm able to work here. This is truly the job that I was born to do.
Oh no... I won... They're gonna cut my pay...
My job is to let people win. It's all right. No problems here.
You're acting pretty brave for a half-pint! You may have bitten off more than you can chew!
That wasn't a bad attempt, but I warned you I'd be tough!
Guess I've started to soften up. Hey, can't expect to stay on top of my game forever.
My parents said they're too dangerous, so I made my own Roller Skates.
They're really popular now, so everyone will shun me if I don't at least look like I'm wearing Roller Skates.
They're just for show, so the wheels don't turn. I run really fast to make it seem like I'm rolling.
Honestly, these are inconvenient and hard to walk in. Roller Skates are not suited for getting around.
Always slipping around is annoying! I'm ready to graduate from Roller Skates!
There are only so many places you can skate, anyway. Honestly, they're not useful for getting around.
I'm being marketed as an idol who can sing, dance, and skate, but it's just no good.
When I stop and think about it, being dressed like this all the time makes me more of a comedian than an idol.
I can sing, dance, and skate. Now I'll try to become an idol who can battle, too.
My strategy is to deceive my opponents with my speed.
Ahaha... How was it? I bet that made you dizzy.
How could you be quicker than me? What are you wearing?
I just finished my introductory training. Please battle me!
The content of my training was good. I have to thank my teacher for this!
I made notes of all the things I need to watch out for. I'll take preventive measures before my next battle!
My Pokémon and I are fully prepared! Bring it on, Trainer!
Yes! Battling when in one's best condition is one of the basics of being a Trainer!
I was so well prepared, though... Could it be that my skills are lacking?
Wow...wow... Am I wrong, or are you the Champion?
I just beat the Champion even though I don't even have one Gym Badge...
Haha! I expected no less from the Champion! I am deeply grateful to have been your opponent!
I may still be wet behind the ears, but I aim to be a Veteran someday!
Soon I'll be strong and respected enough that everyone will kneel before me!
I think this result is an investment in my future.
I intend to continue calling myself a Beauty for as long as I can.
After a battle, you have to care for your skin within seconds! You have to be careful, too!
To be called a Beauty forever... That is my mission in life...
My friends and I are part of an event where we try to escape from here!
Huh? Did I win? Then we can't escape!
All right! Now I can make my escape!
I'm a Gardener, but I'm good at Pokémon battles, too.
I'm a Gardener, but maybe I'll try to become the Champion.
I'm a Gardener, so my real job is gardening.
The weather's too awful for me to work! I'm just amusing myself here.
Whoa! I'm in a Sunny Day kind of mood!!
If only my Ability were Rain Dish...
The secret ingredient in my cooking will be your tears!
Ahaha! Cry! That's it, cry for me! With that, this dish is complete!
Uhhn... It's getting cold... I was almost finished cooking...
Hey there, Trainer! Do you think I'm a grown-up?
Tee hee... I won because I'm a grown-up!
Tee hee! My mom did my makeup! I'm actually only seven years old!
Grip and rip, baby! I'm going to keep shooting even if I use up all my film!
Grip and rip, baby! I'm going to keep shooting even if I'm using up all my film!
I really feel like I'm traveling every time the shutter snaps!
I was a fool to think that I would find sweet romance at my destination.
All the other people on this tour are old. There's no way I'll find anyone.
There's no romance or anything else for me in a country where I don't speak the language.
They say that battling local Trainers is part of what makes traveling memorable.
I made some wonderful memories. Thank you very much, local [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.
I didn't need to make any memories like this, local [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.
I put up with a long, long, long, long, long, long, long flight to get here...
I'm sleepy... So sleepy...
I'm sleepy all the time because of jet lag. I don't have the energy for sightseeing...
My husband has no idea, but a long time ago, I used to be a Punk Girl!
My ex-boyfriend gave me all my Pokémon. I'd feel bad if I let them go after all this time.
I like my husband for not prying into my past, trying to find out what I used to be like.
Woo-hoo! I'm looking forward to this! I've always dreamed of battling here!
Marvelous! Fantastic! This feels like a dream! This is paradise for Trainers!
I don't want to go home! I want to stay here forever! I want to live here for the rest of my life!
The secret to my Pokémon's strength is their specially blended food.
How about that? Strong, huh? What you eat is important!
How could that happen to my Pokémon... What are you feeding your Pokémon?
How much time do you spend raising each Pokémon?
I give each one two full days of cherishing, and then it's on to the next!
You've raised your Pokémon well. Are you a passionate Trainer, or do you have a lot of free time on your hands?
When you're tired of training Pokémon, it's time to battle! That's the trick to working as a Breeder!
I'm so talented that I can win just to change my mood.
If I lose, that tells you I was just killing time. It doesn't damage my ego at all.
I've become so absorbed in Pokémon battles that I've started to worry about myself.
When I win a battle, my mind goes blank. It's really worrying.
It was fun even though I lost, but it worries me that I'm not disappointed at all.
Maintaining one's composure no matter the situation is what being a Trainer is all about.
Even in victory, it is auspicious to remain nonchalant, humble, and subdued.
Even in defeat, my heart operates normally without rotting or becoming sad.
My treasured Pokémon and I have been together for a long time. No need to go easy on us.
Hohoho... Is this what they call the wisdom of age?
What an inconsiderate act—beating up on an old man and his Pokémon!
My husband passed before me, so I'm finally free to live the life I want!
When I got older I realized how lovely it is to be alone.
Now if only my son would get himself together, then I'd really be free!
I don't care for children. They're noisy and selfish.
I feel so satisfied when I defeat a child! It feels like I've regained my own youth!
If you think people will go easy on you because you're a child, you're in for a painful lesson.
The only people who can pull off furisode are flashy girls and old ladies, right?
You had better think about your age when picking out clothes, right?
Don't you think old ladies look super cute in furisode?
If you're wondering why I'm dressed like this, isn't it obvious it's for my part-time job?
Our uniforms are furisode, so I get embarrassed when I have to go outside to pick something up.
I think furisode are cute, but they're a bit much for everyday wear.
Hey! It's me. It's me! The Owner of the world!
How's that? Owned, sucka!
Pffft! I wasn't seriously trying or anything! Next time I'll show you some real ownage!
My Pokémon are all extremely rare ones that I acquired on the black market.
See... Look at this glossy coat. I'm slobbering in spite of myself.
You and your Pokémon are nice. Trade Pokémon with me!
My research was supposed to lead the world to peace...
I am a genius. I was supposed to take control of the world...
My experiment failed, so I'm finished in the academic world.
In my pursuit of success, I became lonely beyond all imagining...
The loneliness of genius... There's no way you could possibly comprehend it.
Those with overwhelming abilities can welcome loneliness at times.
I want to experiment! Experiment, I say! My hands are shaking because I want to experiment so badly!
Beakers... Petri dishes... Pipettes... Electron microscope...
Huh huh huh... Somebody let me experiment...
If you follow a fixed set of rules, you can get a definite result.
This result was inevitable. Victory is simply derived.
Th-this isn't beyond the anticipated results! This is still a predictable result!
You don't want to hear about Pokémon from people who know nothing about Pokémon, do you?
You haven't studied enough, but you have potential. I could train you, if you'd like...
Just because you know a lot about battles, it doesn't mean that you know anything about Pokémon!
I've researched on top of research... At last I have derived the answer...
It's that I am a very strong Trainer!
It's that I am a very weak Trainer...
Look into my eyes. That's it. Breathe deeply as I count one, two, three...
Now you're under my spell. You're like a puppet under my command.
My hypnotic powers don't work on you?! What mental fortitude you must possess!
I let it slip that I'm a greenhorn right before the battle.
You're not well enough prepared yet.
Because I'm a greenhorn, I'm not worth mentioning.
I shall make a prophecy... This battle... You will emerge victorious...
You... Are you so weak as to reverse my prophecy?
I'm disappointed, but it can't be helped... My prophecies are absolute...
I grow stronger with each tear I cry.
Don't get hung up on sadness or frustration. You can use your grudges to motivate yourself.
Now I can get even stronger. I grow with every grudge.
Heh... Welcome back... I haven't forgotten your face...
You! Why did you lose? Again? You're trying to fool me again, aren't you?!
Eh...radio waves... There are radio waves coming from your nose...
Kind people are really scary... Why do they have to come so close to me?
Kind people are scary... Their smiling faces and boisterousness are scary...
I just want to be left alone. Dealing with people is such a bother...
Oh, I see. Would you like to be cut to pieces? Or do you prefer the role of punching bag?
You didn't decide quickly enough, so you got a little from column A and a little from column B.
Hmmm... If I was going to lose anyway, I was hoping to get totally messed up in the process.
The sweat that drips before a battle... Don't you love how cool it is?
Being tired from battle with disheveled clothing... It's cool! Isn't it actually the coolest?
At the end of a battle, out of breath... How cool is it? Totally!
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
The adrenaline is pumping in my team! Me, too! I'll make this an awesome battle!
How about it? We're awesome, right? You were able to explode, weren't you?
I did what I came to do, and this is how it turned out. There's nothing else to say.
“Go easy on me” is not in my vocabulary.
To me, etiquette is mercilessly defeating my opponents in battle—even the weak.
Even if I give it my all, it's meaningless when I lose.
Let's have a fun battle! No hard feelings, no matter if we win or lose! ♪
Don't look so down! ♪ I just happened to get lucky! ♪
Heh...
Pokémon battle is not a sport or a hobby. Get out of here if all you want is to play!
Reflect long and hard on what “serious” means.
You didn't take it easy on me at all... That was good. You're a risk taker.
When I'm living without nature in my life, sometimes I'll suddenly feel an anxiety attack coming on.
I'm sure how you feel is not so bad if you compare it to my anxiety attacks...
Something like this is pretty trivial compared to the stifling feelings of city life.
Despite my appearance, I was born a country boy. So I yearned for city life.
You don't go visit your hometown, do you? City life must be nice.
I was born and raised in the country, so the neon lights of the city may be too bright for me.
I'm a nature person, so I was born to be a Ranger!
Being surrounded by nature seems good for your health and your looks, doesn't it?
I'm a marvel of nature!
I'm prepared to protect nature by any means necessary!
Everything has its origin in nature! Everyone should revere it!
Are you listening? Remember this... Never underestimate the power of nature...
You look kind of feeble. How about I put you through the wringer?
Ahaha! Not yet! I'm not done yet!
You did it! Next time, you'll put me through the wringer, huh?
Your Pokémon... Show them to me...
All within my expectations... Nothing to be surprised about...
Yes... You have good Pokémon... Pokémon must be happy to be raised by you...
To challenge me you must be a reckless, fearless person who doesn't know h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser place!
Hmmph... To challenge me must mean that even ignorance has its limit!
You're a smart Trainer, considering you don't know very much.
Even if people call you an Ace Trainer, it's not like you get anything special for it.
I'm just good at battling. I don't even have a job. I'm just another unemployed guy.
In the end, being good at battling alone isn't enough, no matter how strong you are.
Because I'm an Ace Trainer, people think I'm a strong woman.
I thought I'd grow up to be a frail woman who looked like she'd break if you squeezed her too hard.
You have to be strong inside when there aren't many people who are stronger than you on the outside...
There's nothing to do but battle... For us...
This result... is not what I'd hoped for...
I wonder if we could have been friends if we had met in a world with no battles...
Are you aware of what it takes to be an Ace Trainer?
Of course I'm strong and don't lose. It's important that I win gracefully.
You can't become an Ace Trainer battling like that.
Huh? Huh? A battle? Time to go all out!
Terrible! You're extremely unprepared! Come back when you've learned how to throw a Poké Ball!
Oh! You did pretty well, didn't you? You're better than I thought!
Hey now, you're pretty much in a daze... Of course, I am pretty hunky...
I know, I know, you can't help but be fascinated by such a pinnacle of hunkiness.
Even when I lose, I'm still pretty hunky... I'm just that photogenic.
All right then, throw your Poké Ball! I'll catch it right away!
Catching Poké Balls before they open is a surefire way to win that I devised.
Huh... If only I had been able to catch that Poké Ball that time...
I'm, umm, teaching my daughter, umm, about Pokémon. I have to, umm, show her her dad's, umm, dignity.
Umm, is my daughter watching? I did it! Daddy did it!
I, umm, can't let my daughter, umm, see this. She can't see her dad, umm, lose.
Before I knew it, I was being treated like a senior citizen. Time goes by too quickly...
It only makes me angry when people compliment me by saying I'm a Veteran. Don't you get it?
It's too late to tell time to stop. I'm glad I enjoyed myself when I was young.
Oh... Trainer... Isn't it time...for a battle?
Oh... Trainer... Isn't it time...for a battle?
Oh... Trainer... Isn't it time...for a battle?
Adults are pretty unfair, but that's what makes it fun.
If you hurry up and grow up, you can have more fun, too.
Humph... Look at how you look! At your age, you should respect the rules.
Maybe it's because they respect me, but everyone calls me a Veteran.
Veteran... Makes it sound like I'm finished, for some reason.
I'm not grown up enough to be happy about being called a Veteran...
Saying I'm a free spirit sounds good, but really I'm just an unemployed homeless guy!
If I can just live here and play all day, I'll never need to struggle.
Dreaming about being free is the best part...
The clear blue water at the beach! All the bikinis! That's the kind of place I was hoping to get to!
What makes this place a resort? There's nothing but serious Trainers here!
This isn't a resort—it's like torture! There are battles everywhere you go!
I don't think you can say you've been on a trip unless you've interacted with the locals.
This is it... I'm fully enjoying this trip.
If you want to make tourists spend money, provide them with a service.
Shall we go together? To the other side of Pokémon battles...
Not yet. We have not crossed the finish line of Pokémon battles.
You might make it there before me. To the other side of Pokémon Battles...
If my theory is correct, you'll lose with the Pokémon you're about to send out.
I knew it... My theory was correct.
I should know that a theory is just a theory. It was of no use in an actual battle...
I'm going to save up my allowance, and then someday I'll take a trip around the world.
I feel like the world is waiting for me... You know how I feel, right?
Whenever I say the world is calling me, my mom gets angry and says, “No, it isn't! Get to work!”
If you're willing to battle with me, you must have something pretty good, right?
Did you think I would be satisfied with such tiny Pokémon?
You and your Pokémon are nice! You're doing great for your age!
I work at a restaurant where people come on dates a lot, so it's really stressful.
Oh, I feel refreshed! There's nothing like a good battle to perk you up!
Customers who don't even order anything and just sit there flirting are really, like, totally the worst.
Time for a battle haiku! This is really good. My opponent is a kid. I will win for sure.
Time for a battle haiku! I knew I would win. Yes, my Pokémon and I are really this strong.
Time for a battle haiku! I can't believe it. I can still continue on. I can still battle.
If you want to reach the peak as a Trainer, you'll have to climb over me!
Even if you run into me disastrously, there's no rescue team on its way!
Go! You've gotta go! Go on and leave me!
It's merely a Pokémon battle, right? Why so serious?
So what if you lose? It's not like there's any money in winning.
It's not like you really lose anything when you lose. As long as you enjoy it, that's enough.
I don't believe in things like good luck charms, but times like these make me want to pray!
My view is that whether or not your prayers get answered all depends on your own talents!
Maybe I lose because I'm paying more attention to praying than to battling.
I was born in a graveyard and raised in a cemetery. Leave all your curses and grudges to me!
Terrible! You aren't holding enough grudges! If you want to win, put more into your curses!
Defeating me is amazing! You must be kinda cursed, too!
I get stronger by dwelling on the past. That's the way I've lived my life, after all.
Think positive even when you lose? Sounds to me like refusing to admit your mistakes.
Call me negative or whatever you like. This is just who I am.
Awful! That was an awful performance! I refuse to accept a battle ending like this!
What are you doing? You made that worthless! Totally worthless!
Hey, that's why I'm saying this. How could I end up like this?
Hey, kid! Are you scared of me? If you're scared, say you're scared.
Har har har! You were scared of me! My new look is a big success!
Well, I'm a hooligan. If you ain't scared of me, I ain't doin' it right!
I may be bad, but I got nothin' but love for my Pokémon.
I have to spoil my Pokémon to say thanks for winning.
What do you think you're doing to my adorable Pokémon?
My parents are, like, stupidly obsessed with me, so I've grown up to be magnificently stupid.
My parents totally spoil me when I win, so I get pretty full of myself. I mean, wouldn't you?
My parents are totally there for me when I lose, so why bother thinking about what I could've done better?
I've been thinking about opening up a traditional restaurant around here someday.
It takes money to open your own restaurant. That's why I do all these little part-time jobs.
Doesn't a traditional restaurant sound groovy? I can almost hear the quiet murmur of voices...
I may be a Chef, but I have no interest in my own dishes.
I've got no time at all for expensive dishes. Food from the corner store is really good.
You lose interest in whatever you do for a living, don't you?
I am a Butler no more! I'm now just another unemployed old geezer!
If I had known it was going to turn out like this, I wouldn't have run away from the mansion!
Where can I find a new boss? Somebody please hire me!
Working as a Butler is so fun. Even more so if you like gossip!
See this smile? It comes from knowing my employers' secrets.
Being a Butler is fun because you can see a side of people that they hide from everyone.
My employer is watching our battle! Would you please be so kind as to lose to me?
Thank you so much for losing! My employer is sitting over there smiling!
My employer looks angry... I'm in for a reprimand when we get home.
I may be a Maid, but that doesn't mean that I can serve just anybody.
I could never serve you. You're too weak for me to even consider it.
I could see myself serving you. You're quite skilled, and therefore acceptable.
To live life without a moment's pause! Let's enjoy the moment to the full!
You're always short on time during battle. Just like life!
Go forth! Pay no heed to losers! Go, go, and live your life!
Grabbing a Poké Ball for a battle you know you can't win is called being a Trainer.
I am overcome by the reverberations of victory. A toast to our companions in their Poké Balls!
With the tears that pour onto my palette, I shall paint the self-portrait of a loser.
If you describe it as art, you can fool people into spending money on some little brat's scribbles.
People shouldn't trust their eyes to judge things.
Can you trust your own eyes? Do you know what's important to you?
Just walking around town irritates me. It's nothing but ugly buildings and low-class billboards.
I think it's a crime for someone with no taste to make a work for public display.
I want to paint over every bit of the scenery in this ugly town!
Thanks for coming all this way! I'm sorry I don't have much to offer, but do make yourself comfortable.
Leaving already? I had just made some tea, though.
Sorry I couldn't be more accommodating. Have a safe trip home.
I battled too much, threw too many Poké Balls, and blew my shoulder out.
I may have won this time, but I wonder how many more times I'll be able to throw a Poké Ball...
Doing too much of anything will wreck your body. Everything in moderation, OK?
My old lady done left me... I reckon it's all my fault...
Now there ain't nobody buggin' me about stuff, so's I can battle as much as I want!
I got too hooked on Pokémon battles, so's I never did nothin' around the house.
It's no fun if you're not ready to treat it like you're playing instead of battling.
This is still just playing. Just playing. You have to feel as comfortable as that.
Not throwing a tantrum when you lose is part of being a Trainer, right?
I may not get a runner's high, but I get a Roller Skater's rush, so I'm always all smiles!
Hahaha... It just feels so good... I want to keep on skating like this forever...
Battles make you feel good, too. Maybe that's also the work of endorphins.
The problem is knowing whether to put your full force into the starting dash or the last spurt of effort.
Aww... If only you could have saved some strength for the last spurt of effort...
All right! The starting dash decided our battle!
I'm really cheap by nature, so I'm not cut out to be a Roller Skater.
Roller Skates are expensive, and then you have to deal with the maintenance. It's tough.
If you skate too much, the wheels get worn out. It's such a waste.
I'm gonna dive right into your heart! If you don't catch me, I won't forgive you!
You can't catch me with a feeble set of muscles like that!
I told you to catch me, didn't I? You threw me back! Why did you throw me back?!
You had better learn that not everybody gets to be the star of the show.
It took a while before I learned my place.
Keep your capabilities in mind as you go on your way.
Hnnph... You're just some brat... What do you think I am?!
You did better than I thought. You've got quite a bit of potential.
No way... Maybe I was taking you too lightly.
This is battle paradise. Only the strong survive here...
As long as there are Trainers, the banquet will continue for all eternity.
Once you've made it this far, victory and defeat become meaningless.
My life hasn't been a bed of roses— not exactly overflowing with opportunities.
Life is just a series of happenings, one after the next. Can you keep up?
Even if you lack hopes or dreams, as long as you survive, you'll become a Veteran someday.
As long as it tastes good, that's enough. Don't sweat the details.
In cooking and battling, just go for it and don't sweat the small stuff.
You got the details right in that battle... Do you even save time to eat?
I'm in the middle of eating, but would you be so kind as to let me have a look at your Pokémon? Slurp, slurp...
Slurp... This is so tasty... Bring them closer so I can get a good look. Slurp, slurp.
Have you got any more to show me? Slurp, slurp. Don't worry. I won't splash soup on them! Sluuu-uurp!
I do not accept any Pokémon that I do not like.
The only factor in whether or not I like a Pokémon is its strength.
Indeed, you and your Pokémon have strength to spare. I like you.
I'm begging you for a distraction. Show me so much strength that I feel like I must be going crazy.
You can't erase your bad memories. But what you can do is act crazy to fool everybody.
Ah... Ah... Thank you... That was what I needed.
I'm sick and tired of being called a Beauty.
When people call me a Beauty, they don't realize how much pressure that puts on me.
You have to make a lot of sacrifices to be a Beauty. I'm done with that effort. Moving on!
Come on, let's get on with it already! I can't stand it when it's not popping!
Regrets from the past, worries about the future— forget all that! All that matters is the here and now!
I want to get to the point where I can feel good about the way I live my life.
Pardon me, but may I ask to use your facilities?
In this part of the world, do you sic your Pokémon on someone asking a simple question?
No, really! Point me in the right direction while there's still time!
What? This isn't a battle appreciation tour, but a battle participation tour?!
I wouldn't have come if I had known it was going to be this kind of tour! Give me my money back!
I paid all that money to battle? What weirdo would want to do that?
This was supposed to be a one-night stop. But before I knew it, we started staying in one place after the next.
By the time I realized what was happening, I was lounging on a hotel bed. I know it's wrong, but I can't stop.
There's no way this is good for my bank account. I know it's wrong, but the comfort is irresistible!
My trip isn't over yet! I'll keep on traveling!
If I defeat my opponent, my tour won't come to an end...
I don't want to go home! I want to keep traveling!
If you believe you can win, you should be able to. If you think you'll lose, you probably will.
This might be useful for you to learn. Your preconceived notions are more powerful than you think.
No matter how mentally prepared you are, weak Trainers are weak! Hahaha!
I smell a person of exceptional courage. Ho! I'm looking forward to this!
Ugh! You're not what I was hoping for! You and your Pokémon have some growing up to do.
Ha! That was just the power I was hoping for! We're similar—no, just the same, you and I!
I have a special method that I use to nurture my Pokémon.
My nurturing methods are perfect! I could beat the Champion with ease, I bet!
Why did it turn out like this? Didn't my Pokémon like the feed I was using?!
As a top Breeder, I'll be using Pokémon with a certified pedigree.
The pedigree and upbringing of my Pokémon are totally different than some mutt's!
Unngh. What disappointment... I can't allow myself to lose to mutts.
You can't win just by pretending to be a Trainer! Have a look at my true self!
Argh! Arrgh!
Ugh! Ug-ugh!
“Eyes! Aim for the eyes!” Those were my big brother's last words...
My big brother was right... Watch over me, bro...
My bad... Bro... I should've listened to my bro...
In the end, this world is all about money. Even these Pokémon...
I used my money to acquire my Pokémon. This is the power of being an adult.
If you understand the meaning of what I'm saying, then why are you here?
Ah! Flowers and storms will be overcome! ♪ As I travel down the path of a battling woman! ♪
Oh! I've got myself a win! ♪ Walk on, down the path of a battling woman! ♪
Losing, crumbling, weeping! ♪ The path of a traveling woman is closing! ♪
Throwing Poké Balls to while away your tedious hours can make you stronger.
Now that the battle's over, I will again be afflicted by the same old tedium.
I don't care if I win or lose, as long as I can escape from this tedium.
For reals? Like, a battle for reals? Whoa, crazy! Like, too crazy!
For reals? Did I, like, win for reals?! Whoa, crazy! Like, I'm too strong!
Whoa, for reals? Did I, like, lose for reals?! Whoa, life. Like, life is woe.

Hi, how are you? I'm Nita! Oh, how I've missed you, Champion! The strongest Trainer in all of Hoenn, is it then? At last I can go all out! So let's get cracking on it! Prepare yourself!
Eh, that was a savage battle, Champion! So what do you think of a serious Nita now? Quite the change? I hardly know myself! I know some folks think I'm a bit of a layabout, but I'm one to relish a real challenge. That reminds me! We've got a Battle Maison in Kalos as well. Come see us there, too! The Battle Maison and Nita will always be here and waiting for your visit, lovie! I'll even wet the tea, so come on by soon!
Wahey! That was great fun! You are a strong one, Champion! It's been a while since someone bested me when I was trying my utmost to win! I can hardly wait for the next battle between us, you bold thing! The Battle Maison and Nita will always be here and waiting for your visit! You'd better come again—and no guff!
Uh-um... Do...do you remember me? You don't...do you... Of course... I-I'm Evelyn... U-um... You truly are the Hoenn Champion, aren't you, dear guest? Ah... I don't want to fight... You look too scary... I want to go home... O-oh! I'm so sorry! My sister would go spare if she were to hear me saying such things now! L-let's just have the battle, shall we? I'll do my best! Honest, I really will! You can just fight however you'd like!
A-a-ahhhh no! A-are you all right?! Oh no... What do I do... I must have lost me mind... Ughhh... I'm s-so sorry... I promise I'll do it right next time... So please...please come challenge me to a Double Battle again...
Hah... Hah... You're so strong... And so scary... I can't take any more... Um... Dear guest... I'm s-so sorry... I...I tried as hard I could, but... I'm so knackered... I'll keep trying harder, so...please... You must challenge me to a Double Battle again...
Hee hee hee... I've been waiting for you, I have, Champion. Me Pokémon and I are burning up to face you... Let's get on with it, then!
Hehehe! What are you gawking at now? The savage mess you made o' the battle? Ha! I'm not havin' a dig at you—it's just great fun to battle hard after holdin' back! But I can tell you could be stronger yet! Come back when you've upped your game, eh? Oh, and one last thing, pet... Don't go tellin' me big sister that I'm doing whatever I please here at home in Hoenn, will you, lovey? Th-that sister of mine... When she tears into a person... Well, n-never mind. Just come back again, ye great lump! I'll be waiting for Triple Battles!
Whisht! To think I'd lose again! I wasn't holding back in the slightest! Don't I look a right fool for underestimating the power of the Champion? But...ehh... Hehehe... It was really good fun, wasn't it? I've devoted me whole life to battling, and now at last I've got a purpose. I'm going to keep getting stronger... Then I'll surely beat you! So until I do, you'd better not lose now!
If you're free for a time, come on by. ♪ If you're bored for a while, stop on in. ♪ Battle till you burst, oh, won't you try? ♪ For a good battle, the Battle Maison Replica's just fine. ♪ You're not bad, guest. You're really not. Sure, to keep coming to see me like this. I'm the eldest of us four Battle Chatelaine sisters, Morgan. And I'm delighted and excited! I have been counting down the days till I might get to face you again like this, sure. Let's get started with the battle at once, and mind yourself that you don't lose! I tell you, I may not be a top-class Trainer... But I put everything I am into treating you to the loveliest battle you've ever had!
Thank you for the battle, love! Did you have a bit of fun yourself? I tell ya, did you know that we've got a Battle Maison like this one here in Hoenn over in Kalos as well? Me sisters and I would be more than happy to entertain you there, too! Please do give us a visit. I'll be taking me leave now, but I do look forward to your next visit, pet!
Just the outcome I would expect... Honestly, I'm not telling fibs! You really are the Trainer I thought you were, aren't you now, pet? Heh heh... Might I ask something? Would you consider becoming the owner here? Me sisters and I have to be returning to our Battle Maison in Kalos someday. I suppose we'd feel safe trusting you with the Battle Maison name. There would also be the matter of our plans to build an even more impressive battle facility in the area. If we get our ducks in a row now, we may make oodles when we leave here. No more talk about it now, but do consider the idea, won't you, pet? Well then, I wait eagerly for our next battle and for your favorable reply!
Hi, how are you! It's Nita's turn! Welcome to the Battle Maison Replica! I'll be doing Multi Battles myself with my eldest sis, Morgan, today! Oh, but you two don't look all that fierce strong anyway, do you now. I don't doubt I could take you both on alone and do a handy job of it, too. Well, let's get cracking!
Nita: Th...thank goodness... Thank goodness I could win... If I lost to the two of ye now... My sister would've... She'd've... Aye, I would've had to leg it...
Nita: No, no, no! How could I— This is terrible altogether! How could you do this to me, you wee, rotten Trainers?! Do ye not even know what Morgan'll do to me now?!
Now, Nita? Did you honestly think I'd ever let you get away with saying such things? Our guests don't look strong, is it? You could beat them both, is it? You go throwing shapes like that, you had better be ready to leg it! And aren't I always warning you about the way you speak to guests? Is your head cut, girl! Have you not a shred of scruple in your body? If you lose now, you'll never hear the end of it!
Morgan: Well, Nita. Lucky for you, your opponent was having a rough day, so you were able to walk away the winner. I'll do you a favor this one time only. But you had better remember what I'm telling you. Understand? You're too old to be so bold. If you greet guests with that kind o' cheek, it may be bad for business. Now, my dear guests... I hope you'll hear my apology and allow me to beg forgiveness for my sister's rude words. I do hope you'll see fit to return to our Battle Maison again someday.
Morgan: ... NITA! Oh, I'll do you, you little waster! First, you mouth off to our guests, with your boasting and insulting them so... And then you lose in battle despite it?! Do you even take this work seriously?! Could you ever face our dear ma and da, rest 'em, after such shocking behavior?! My dear guest... I am deeply sorry for this experience. I beg you will somehow overlook it and visit our Battle Maison Replica again. Now I must have a...discussion with my wee sister. You'll excuse us...
Welcome to the Battle Maison! I'm Dana, and I run things at this Battle Maison! I'm the second oldest of us Battle Chatelaine sisters! And here we have my partner...
Dana: ...[WAIT 30] Sorry.[WAIT 30] Me little sister didn't give you a[WAIT 30] fair shake in that battle...[WAIT 30] Dana! Well, are you listening then?[WAIT 30] Catching somebody off their guard[WAIT 30] like that is the height of cowardice, it is!
Dana: Nita![WAIT 30] We only lost the battle because you went and[WAIT 30] started it without waiting for me to be ready![WAIT 30] The key to any Multi Battle is being[WAIT 30] in perfect sync with your partner![WAIT 30] Can you not get that through[WAIT 30] your thick skull, you moppet?!
Eh, you and your innocent act, Dana! Forget the show! Let's just get on with it. Is this to be a battle or not, eh? I'm always up for a challenge, and I'm ready to start right now! There! You're wide open! I'll take you down!
Nita: Ah, yer sister! Why should I?[WAIT 30] They're the ones at fault for being wide open![WAIT 30] I swear, Dana, you'll drive me crackers[WAIT 30] with your rules and manners.[WAIT 30] Pokémon battles should be fought as we like,[WAIT 30] and who's to tell us otherwise?[WAIT 30] As long as it's good fun for everyone,[WAIT 30] where's the harm?[WAIT 30] I'll stake my life that you secretly agree with me.[WAIT 30] And I'd suppose these two feel the same.[WAIT 30] That was a grand battle altogether,[WAIT 30] and I hope we can do it again sometime!
Nita: What's the situation, then? I don't see[WAIT 30] why I need to care about that sort of thing![WAIT 30] All a battle has to be is cracking good fun![WAIT 30] Besides that, my real specialty is Single Battle[WAIT 30] and has been since year dot![WAIT 30] Who cares a fig about being in sync?[WAIT 30] As for you two, I hope I'll see each of you[WAIT 30] in a Single Battle sometime!
What kind of Pokémon will you be battling with? Hurry up and show me already, would you?
Well, I lost the battle, but at least I got to see some amazing Pokémon. That's fine by me!
I sure hope you'll bring a bit more impressive Pokémon along for our next battle, OK?
Whoa! What kind of luck is this? How did I get stuck battling someone so strong off the bat?!
Argh! I've lost! I couldn't do a thing against you!
I...won? Hah hah! Take that! I'm pretty good myself, huh?
My Pokémon are my friends! Take this! It's the power of our friendship!
My friends tried their best, but we were still no competition for you and your team!
Did you see that?! That's the power of our friendship, all right!
I came here because I wanted to take part in a fiery Pokémon battle of passion!
That was exactly the kind of battle that I came here for! Thanks for showing me a good time!
Hmm. I really wanted to experience something more climactic than that. Guess that battle was a dud.
All right! Here I go! I'm going to battle you with the same old strategy I always use!
You have some amazing strategies yourself! I've learned a lot from this battle!
It went just as it always does! Hahaha! Looks like I win again!
I'd rather battle Pokémon than sleep! I'd even rather battle than eat! So come on already!
That's it! That's exactly the kind of battle I love! Yup, that's what battling you made me feel like.
Come on, pal! Do me a favor and bring some stronger Pokémon along next time, won't you?
You look like you could do some decent battling yourself! Hah, this is beginning to look promising!
That was a fantastic attack there! Let's battle one another again someday!
That was not a bad showing on your part. Come challenge me again someday, won't you?
Hahaha! Come battle against me, my Pokémon, and my blindingly beautiful smile!
Hmph... Well, your Pokémon was rather charming as well, wasn't it? Though not as much as me!
My charming Pokémon gave its all for that battle against you! And all for me!
Let's go all out, but fight fairly!
Thank you very much for battling me squarely!
It seems our side was just a little bit stronger.
Be shocked by the strength of my Pokémon! Tremble before us!
I was shocked by the strength of your Pokémon! I trembled before them!

I wanted to play more! It ended too soon!
My Pokémon are unbeatable! They won't lose!
Why?! My unbeatable Pokémon...
Amazing, aren't they? My unbeatable Pokémon!
I'll win the tournament with the Pokémon that I have worked so hard to get!
What? Why did this Pokémon lose?!
Yes! I knew it. This Pokémon really is the strongest!
If you get scared, it's OK to run. Don't push yourself. Just surrender!
Whoa! Please wait! You... You've got me.
Tee hee! I showed you the difference between your abilities and mine!
Hmm... I wonder what kind of strategy you're going to use.
I just couldn't read your attack at all...
Your strategies clearly need work!
I'll send you flying with my extraordinary attack!
Eek! You sent my Pokémon flying!
Hee hee! You won't beat me unless you train your Pokémon even harder!
My well-thought-out strategy is my biggest weapon!
What? You outsmarted me?! What a clever Trainer!
You fell for my tricks! This is how I battle!
Watch this! These are my best partner Pokémon!
Ha ha ha... There's always someone better...
Is that all you've got? You'll never be able to beat my partners like that!
My heart always races out of control before a Pokémon battle!
Thank you for making my heart pound so much!
There's nothing that lifts my heart like the sweet taste of victory!
I hope that my Pokémon battle with you will become a wonderful memory!
This bitter memory of defeat... I won't ever forget it!
This battle against you will be a memory that I'll treasure!
I'll show you what it takes to be a World Champion!
If you've managed to beat me, then that makes you the strongest Trainer in the world!
Now do you understand what it means to be the strongest in the world?
How about I show you the strength that won at the Pokémon World Championships?
If you beat me, that means that you're strong enough to win at the Pokémon World Championships!

That's right! I won't be defeated that easily!
You want to battle with me, the third-place winner from the Pokémon World Championships?

H-how could I lose... Ooohhh! It's just so frustrating!
Gwa-ha-ha-ha! You're about 10 years early if you think you can take me on!
OK, here we go! Let's battle!
Wow, you're really amazing! You must really love your Pokémon, right?
Pretty pretty please! Give me that victory!
I don't want to lose anymore! Never, ever again!
What is this?! Ahhhhh! I'm sorry, my Pokémon!
I'm over the moon!!!
This is a team made for winning! They say that honest effort will never betray you!
What... Is this for real?
I'm the one who's beaten everyone in the nation!
I don't really know what you want from me, but I just have to battle a bit, right?
There's, like, no way I could have won against such a strong opponent. That's crazy.
Huh? I won? What did I do? What happened? I don't get it. Can you explain?
I'm always serious and ready to go! I'm going to give it my all again today!
WHAT?! Are you serious?! I stayed up all night thinking of that strategy!
See! Everything went just as I expected it to! My calculations were flawless!
C'mon! C'mon! Faster! Let's go! My Pokémon are chomping at the bit!
What a world! You're amazing! Be my friend, why don't you?
I get to fight everyone in the world! I love it! This is what living's for, pal!
The word that can unite people around the world... That word is “Pokémon”!
Battles all come down to the luck of a moment! You're amazing for having that luck on your side!
You've got to smile whether you win or lose! That's what it means to be with Pokémon!
It doesn't matter who your opponent is. All you need is the appropriate method, and you will win.
Even with the ideal method, I could not win... Your team is nothing short of amazing.
In any pursuit in life, you must fix your eyes on your desired outcome and proceed accordingly.
Aha! Even halfhearted moves are enough to befuddle an opponent!
Aha! A truly strong opponent will not be led astray by such moves!
Aha! You seem to have confused yourself in your effort to befuddle your opponent.
These competitions are like a wild party, right? You never know what will come at you!
Your battling style is not bad! Your Pokémon seemed to have fun, too!
I was just having a good time, but I accidentally went and won. Sorry about that!
What I want is the glory of victory! I'm going to wrest myself some glory with all my might!
I'm frustrated with all my might! I'm not going to forget you!
It was what I wanted with all my might! That's why I could seize victory for myself!
I only use the coolest moves! 'Cause I want to win while looking cool!
I guess that just plain winning is cooler than even the coolest moves...
Any moves will look cool when we're the ones using them! Hah!
Every meeting in life is precious; every encounter to be cherished. Let's make our Pokémon happy!
I must use this defeat as fuel for my improvement and grow stronger. Let's meet again!
Win or lose, each battle is a unique experience that only comes once in life. I'm glad we got to battle.

Can you see that? Right in front of you! That giant right there is a Balloon Bot! “Secrets to Super Training Success: Hit those goals before you get hit!” Use the Circle Pad on your Nintendo 3DS to move your Pokémon around the virtual space! Tap and drag on the lower screen to both aim and shoot a special ball at the goal! Aim for the white goals that appear in front of the Balloon Bots, and shoot like mad! Good luck! Time to work out!
Hey, champ! We've been waiting for you! This time I'll teach you about a secret, special way to shoot in your Super-Training Regimens! “Secrets to Super Training Success: Energy Shots for the win, baby! Get 'em!” You see that round meter down low in the middle of your Nintendo 3DS system's upper screen? That special meter shows you how much energy your Pokémon has—its oomph! When you're full of that energy, the shots you let loose transform into Energy Shots! Energy Shots will vary by Pokémon, and they'll even look different when you see 'em! They're the way to really win! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Keep an eye out for the opponent's shots!” When a shot from a Balloon Bot hits you, you'll lose some of the points you earned! If you reach the time limit without enough points, it'll be game over for your regimen! Use the Circle Pad to move and get away from incoming shots! Can you dodge 'em all?! Well, you're about to find out! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Aim for bonus goals while you still can!” The white goals that appear in front of Balloon Bots disappear after one hit, OK? But red goals are special bonus goals you earn, and they won't disappear after one hit! Hit 'em again and again and again—until they disappear after a set amount of time! You ready for another regimen? Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Keep an eye out for the opponent's shots!” When a shot from a Balloon Bot hits you, you'll lose some of the points you earned! If you reach the time limit without enough points, it'll be game over for your regimen! Use the Circle Pad to move and get away from incoming shots! Can you dodge 'em all?! Well, you're about to find out! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Focus, and predict your opponent's moves!” When goals appear on the arms, wings, or other moving bits of Balloon Bots, taking aim is no longer a simple matter! Will you study how the Balloon Bots move before letting loose your shots? Or are you the type to use wild potshots?! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Focus, and predict your opponent's moves!” When goals appear on the arms, wings, or other moving bits of Balloon Bots, taking aim is no longer a simple matter! Will you study how the Balloon Bots move before letting loose your shots? Or are you the type to use wild potshots?! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Don't let a single goal get away unhit!” When several goals appear at once, it is your chance to get in some serial hits! Take aim at each, and be sure to hit it! It's the trick to beating a regimen in a flash! I hope you're ready to go! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Use barriers to guard yourself in a pinch!” Sometimes you simply cannot dodge an opponent's shots. Here's what to do then! Press the L Button, and you'll be able to throw up a barrier to protect yourself! This barrier will keep any opponent's shots from hitting you for a short period of time! But you can't keep using your barrier nonstop, so don't go wasting it! Ready that L Button! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Let 'er fly! Release that Charged Shot!” If you keep your stylus pressed to the Touch Screen, your Pokémon will be enveloped by a special, glowing aura! While that aura is burning bright, lift the stylus from the Touch Screen, and boom! You'll let loose with a super-high-power Charged Shot that'll net you triple points! But be careful—if you wait too long, your aura will fizzle out and disappear! You ready to give it a shot? Good luck! Time to work out!

But you can't keep using your barrier nonstop, so don't go wasting it! Ready that L Button! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Bust through the Bitbots to win!” Bitbots are small, AI-powered bots that Balloon Bots can summon at will! These lovable little bits of errant data can act as a shield to protect their parent Balloon Bot. And even when you defeat them, give 'em enough time, and they'll regenerate on you! Do you think you're ready for them? Good luck! Time to work out!

“Secrets to Super Training Success: Break down the opponent's barriers!” When a Balloon Bot is surrounded by a barrier, none of your Pokémon's shots will hit it! But barriers aren't invincible, and you can knock 'em down if you try hard enough! Ready to find the crack in those defenses? Good luck! Time to work out!

“Secrets to Super Training Success: What in the world is Circuit Training?!” Circuit Training! It is a brutal regimen that features two or more Balloon Bots in a row! The way each Balloon Bot moves may be different, so keep your eyes peeled! Are you ready to take on this parade?! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: To the speediest go the spoils!” You've probably noticed by now, but clearing a Secret Super-Training Regimen gets you items, as well as regular training bags! And there's more—if you clear a regimen a lot faster than the set target time, you'll have a better chance at getting a rare item! Think you can do it? Good luck! Time to work out!

“Secrets to Super Training Success: Watch out for that furious counter!” The Balloon Bot you face in this regimen will get faster as you get more points. Its shots get more powerful, too! Its moves may change suddenly, so keep a steady head! I hope you're ready for this challenge! Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: Strike first and fast if you want to win big!” The Balloon Bot you face in this regimen lets off quick, ferocious shots from the start! As you get more points, though, it will start to get a bit sluggish, so hit it first to win! I hope you're ready for this challenge! Good luck! Time to work out!

“Secrets to Super Training Success: Discover the thrill of a one-hit game over!” The Balloon Bot you will face in this regimen shoots off incredibly strong shots!

Are you ready for this challenge? Good luck! Time to work out!
“Secrets to Super Training Success: The time is now! Give it your all!” Great job! You've made it to the very last Secret Super-Training Regimen! There is nothing more to teach you now— just get out there and give it your all! Are you ready for the ultimate challenge? Good luck! Time to work out!

Get your feet wet! Learn the ins and outs of a Super-Training Regimen by hitting the goals that appear in front of the Balloon Bot!
Store up all your energy to attack! Get your timing right, then let loose on a goal with a great Energy Shot!
Time to work on that Sp. Atk stat! As your Sp. Atk stat increases, your shots will get even stronger—and get you more points!
Time to build up that HP stat! With a higher HP stat, your shots get more accurate and you don't lose points as easily when hit!
Time to work on that Attack stat! As your Attack stat increases, your shots will get even stronger—getting you more points!
Time to work on that Sp. Def stat! Higher Sp. Def will make it easier for you to store up energy for your Energy Shots!
Time to work on that Speed stat! You'll be able to move more quickly. Faster shots means more shots, so get out there!
Time to work on that Defense stat! Higher Defense will make it easier for you to store up energy for your Energy Shots!
Should you go left? Should you go right? Up? Down? There's only a moment to decide! Dodge those tricky homing shots!
If you want a red bonus goal to appear, then you've got to blast away every last one of the regular white goals first! Grab that chance!
Watch out! This Balloon Bot will keep firing an endless barrage of shots at your Pokémon! Do you think you can dodge them all?!
What are those mysterious objects called “Bitbots” that float around the Balloon Bots like that?!
A Balloon Bot that soars up in the sky! Calm down and take careful aim if you want even a chance to hit this wily target!
A mysterious force seems to be protecting the Balloon Bot from any harm... What is this barrier, and how can you beat it?!
Duck sideways for vertical shots! Soar up or down for horizontal ones! You've gotta dodge these tricky missiles!
Some shots are headed straight for your Pokémon—but not all of them! Can you tell the difference in time?!
Even the most furious offense follows some sort of pattern! Your only chance at victory lies in the challenge of finding that pattern!
Can you blast away the Bitbots in your way? You might have to if you want to complete this Super-Training Regimen in time!
If you wanna dodge these high-speed shots, you've got to be ready to move the instant the Balloon Bot fires 'em! Maybe even before!
Destroy the yellow marks around that pesky barrier to destroy the Balloon Bot's strong defense and grasp your chance for points!
Don't let your guard down just because you beat one Balloon Bot! There's a nonstop barrage awaiting you in this Circuit Training!
Do your best to finish within the target time! If you can, you might just be lucky enough to find a rare prize: a Leaf Stone!
Do your best to finish within the target time! If you can, you might just be lucky enough to find a rare prize: a Fire Stone!
Do your best to finish within the target time! If you can, you might just be lucky enough to find a rare prize: a Water Stone!
What's with these crazy, changing goals?! Memorize the patterns if you hope to hit the next one in time!
Your chance for victory might just betray you! When you think you've got it in the bag is exactly when this Balloon Bot shoots back!
Your crisis will become the chance for victory! If you can just make it past the first hurdle, you'll have a chance to turn this one around!
If you keep a close eye on this Balloon Bot's shots, a flawless victory isn't out of reach! Dodge every last shot that comes at you!
Revenge is best served cold, you know! This Balloon Bot is back from the tutorial and ready to take back all those points!
Try to accurately hit these constantly moving goals while dodging a merciless barrage of shots! Do you think you can do it?!
One wrong step will set you back to zero! You'll have to avoid every last one of this Balloon Bot's nullifying shots to win!
Secret Super-Training Regimens are the last hurdle for your Pokémon to overcome! The ultimate training for the ultimate Pokémon!
Watch for it! When this Balloon Bot turns its back, the shots will fly! Be ready for a barrage if you hope to pull through this one!
This Balloon Bot's arms will slow down right after letting loose a shot—that's your chance! Use the opening to launch your bid for points!
The easiest way to dodge these cross-shaped shots is to dodge diagonally! But don't forget that you can also use a barrier in a pinch!
Can you dodge 'em all?! Watch out for big shots, homing shots, and the shots from all those pesky Bitbots—all at once!
Who knew that S.T. could pay so well?! The rewards for this regimen are items that can be sold at a high price to shops!
Take on Balloon Bot after Balloon Bot—and each one requires a completely different strategy! Give this one everything you've got!

I went to the Poké Mart in [VAR LOCATION(0001)] the other day for some [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)]. I ended up buying [VAR NUMBRNCH(0003,0005)]just [VAR NUM3(0003)][VAR NUMBRNCH(0003,0808)], though of them!
The other day I went to the Pokémon Day Care to pick up the [VAR PKNAME(0000)] I'd left there. It had leveled up all the way to Lv. [VAR NUM3(0004)]. That was a real surprise!
I actually won [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR ITEM2(0002)] playing at the Loto-ID Center the other day!

I've entered the Hall of Fame [VAR NUM5(0005,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0005,0100)]s! Pretty impressive, right?

Have you ever tried doing a Wonder Trade? I was really shocked when I got [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR PKNAME(0000)] in a Wonder Trade!
Awww, [VAR PKNAME(0000)]... Why are you just so darn cute...
I'm going to get [VAR PKNAME(0000)] perfectly trained and make it the strongest Pokémon out there!
If it's my awesome [VAR PKNAME(0000)], I'm pretty sure it could win in any [VAR 01A2(0006)]... What do you think?
Do you know about those secret Mirage spots you can find? You can find a Pokémon called [VAR PKNAME(0000)] at one of them!

I love the [VAR 01AE(0006)] at the Mauville Food Court! But so does everyone else! It took so long for my order to come up the other day that I could battle [VAR NUM2(0001)] Trainer[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s!
Have you tried to beat your best time on the Cycling Road? My best record is [VAR NUM2(0002)].[VAR NUM2(0003)] seconds!

[VAR BE05(0001)]This is an HNN special report.[WAIT 30] This morning, before dawn,[WAIT 5] the Mossdeep Space Center[WAIT 5] announced the cancellation of the[WAIT 5] star show that was about[WAIT 5] to be opened to the public.[WAIT 30] Details surrounding why the show[WAIT 5] was canceled have not[WAIT 5] been made public.[WAIT 5] Those who had been looking[WAIT 5] forward to the show have been[WAIT 5] voicing their dissatisfaction with[WAIT 5] this sudden cancellation.
[VAR BE05(0001)]This is an HNN special report.[WAIT 30] Yesterday, the astronomical event[WAIT 5] that everyone was apprehensive[WAIT 5] about was safely observed[WAIT 5] all across the Hoenn region.[WAIT 30] We've been hearing from[WAIT 5] many people, and not just[WAIT 5] astronomy buffs, that they were[WAIT 5] very happy to be able to[WAIT 5] experience the beauty of[WAIT 5] the Litleonid meteor shower[WAIT 5] lighting up the starry night sky.[WAIT 30] Surely there are many people who[WAIT 5] will keep a snapshot of that star[WAIT 5] show, which is said to come once[WAIT 5] every thousand years, in the[WAIT 5] photo album in their hearts.
[VAR BE05(0001)]Interviewer: Greetings![WAIT 5] How are all[WAIT 5] our viewers doing out there? It's[WAIT 5] time for Today's Smart Shopper![WAIT 30] Today, I've come to this great shop[WAIT 5] in [VAR LOCATION(0001)] to[WAIT 5] ask which items have been[WAIT 5] flying off the shelves lately.[WAIT 30] Let's ask one of the staff right now![WAIT 30] So, what's your number-one seller?
Clerk: Well, thank you for asking.[WAIT 5] I'd say that [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)][WAIT 5] have been selling really well lately.[WAIT 30] I even had this one Trainer named[WAIT 5] @s come in the other[WAIT 5] day to buy [VAR NUM4(0003,002C)] of them!
Interviewer: Phew! It takes some[WAIT 5] deep pockets to buy up [VAR NUM4(0003,0000)][WAIT 5] [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)] at once![WAIT 30] I bet that @s of yours[WAIT 5] was getting ready for an adventure![WAIT 30] I know I always want to have [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0002)] or [VAR NUM4(0003,002C)] for[WAIT 5] any journey that I'm on!
Interviewer: Oh, that reminds me![WAIT 5] Speaking of [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)],[WAIT 5] I bought one myself the other day.[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)] are handy[WAIT 5] and wonderful and, well...[WAIT 5] They're just great to have on you!
Interviewer: Really?[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)]?[WAIT 5] And [VAR NUM4(0003,002C)] of them?![WAIT 5] I never even imagined that anyone[WAIT 5] would buy so many at once.[WAIT 5] I never buy more than one or two at[WAIT 5] a time myself.[WAIT 5]
Interviewer: I remember one time,[WAIT 5] way back when, I bought a whole[WAIT 5] lot of [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0002)], too.[WAIT 5] But I had so many left over that I[WAIT 5] ended up with real buyer's regret.[WAIT 5] Now I just try to buy what I need.[WAIT 5] Oops! But I guess talking about[WAIT 5] myself doesn't really help!
Clerk: Well, it was a really great[WAIT 5] sale, so I guess it's natural to want[WAIT 5] to stock up!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Interviewer: Hmm, hmmm...[WAIT 5] I guess that @s must[WAIT 5] really know how to spot a deal.[WAIT 30] Let's see, the total for that purchase[WAIT 5] was...[WAIT 5] Just $[VAR 0209(0004,002C)]?![WAIT 5] Whoa! That really was a great deal![WAIT 5] Well, that's all we have time for[WAIT 5] today, but catch us again for more[WAIT 5] of the best deals![WAIT 5] Bye for now, bargain hunters!
[VAR BE05(0001)]The time has come for the latest[WAIT 5] episode of The Name Rater Show![WAIT 5] Using the nickname bestowed[WAIT 5] on a Pokémon, I will tell its fortune![WAIT 30] Today's guest is @s,[WAIT 5] with [VAR iCOLOR2(0001)][VAR PKNAME(0001)] nicknamed[WAIT 5] [VAR PKNICK(0002)]! Now let me see...[WAIT 30] Mm-hmm...[WAIT 5] Oh, yes. Hmm...[WAIT 5] This Pokémon's nickname tells me...
[VAR BE05(0001)]That this Pokémon has a great[WAIT 5] penchant for battle! Indeed![WAIT 5] Even when you think it might lose,[WAIT 5] this Pokémon won't give up![WAIT 5] It'll strike fear into opponents with a[WAIT 5] vibe that says, “You're gonna miss!”[WAIT 30]
[VAR BE05(0001)]That this Pokémon will be very[WAIT 5] spoiled by its Trainer! What a life![WAIT 5] It always wants @s to[WAIT 5] fuss over it and care for it.[WAIT 30] And yet I also get the feeling that...[WAIT 5] Yes, the sounds of [VAR PKNICK(0002)][WAIT 5] tell me that you should definitely[WAIT 5] give this Pokémon a lot of love in[WAIT 5] Pokémon-Amie!
[VAR BE05(0001)]That this Pokémon has quite a bit[WAIT 5] of happiness waiting for it![WAIT 5] If it uses Thunder in battle,[WAIT 5] it'll succeed about 70 percent[WAIT 5] of the time![WAIT 5] Yes... That's right.[WAIT 5] It's quite average, isn't it?[WAIT 5] [VAR PKNICK(0002)] is a pretty average[WAIT 5] nickname, after all.[WAIT 5] What it all boils down to is that[WAIT 5] being average is no bad thing!
[VAR BE05(0001)]That it is one thoughtful Pokémon![WAIT 5] That's what kind of name it has.[WAIT 30] If you put this one in a contest,[WAIT 5] I don't know why exactly, but I think[WAIT 5] it could show off its appeal at just[WAIT 5] the right time to excite the crowd.[WAIT 5] Yup, that's what “[VAR PKNICK(0002)]”[WAIT 5] suggests to me anyhow.[WAIT 5] It makes me think of an old couple.
[VAR BE05(0001)]That this Pokémon is destined to[WAIT 5] have some ups and downs in life![WAIT 30] I'd say that the future in store[WAIT 5] for it will be anything but mediocre![WAIT 5] This name is like when you finally[WAIT 5] meet a Shiny Pokémon in the wild—[WAIT 30] and then you knock it out with a[WAIT 5] critical hit! Arrrghhh![WAIT 30] Yup, that's what “[VAR PKNICK(0002)]”[WAIT 5] sounds like to my ears.[WAIT 5] I see lots of drama for this one.
[VAR BE05(0001)]The name “[VAR PKNICK(0002)].”[WAIT 5] Well, @s, I have to say[WAIT 5] that nickname seems a bit lacking in[WAIT 5] the love department, you know?[WAIT 30] If you want to understand your[WAIT 5] [VAR PKNAME(0001)] a bit better,[WAIT 5] how about renaming it[WAIT 5] “@s”?[WAIT 30] With the same name, maybe you'd[WAIT 5] understand your Pokémon as much[WAIT 5] as you understand yourself!
[VAR BE05(0001)]The name “[VAR PKNICK(0002)]” really[WAIT 5] captures the love you have for your[WAIT 5] Pokémon, @s![WAIT 30] My, my...[WAIT 5] How can I say this?[WAIT 5] It's like... It's like, @s,[WAIT 5] [VAR PKNICK(0002)] completes you.[WAIT 5] [VAR PKNICK(0002)] supports you a lot,[WAIT 5] doesn't it?[WAIT 5] You have noticed that, right?[WAIT 5] You'd better notice it!
[VAR BE05(0001)]This nickname, well...[WAIT 5] You did spend [VAR NUM4(0003,002C)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0003,0100)]s on[WAIT 5] deciding it, so I guess that tells you[WAIT 5] all you need to know![WAIT 5] @s, you really put a lot[WAIT 5] into that name, didn't you?
[VAR BE05(0001)]But you know, @s, I've[WAIT 5] got to say that you pick some fine[WAIT 5] nicknames for your Pokémon.[WAIT 5] I hope you'll continue looking after[WAIT 5] [VAR PKNICK(0002)] with as much care[WAIT 5] as you clearly put into its name.[WAIT 30] I hope fate has it in store for us to[WAIT 5] meet again!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: Yo, everybody![WAIT 5] Welcome to Trend Shoot![WAIT 5] Today we're gonna surf out again[WAIT 5] on the new wave of what's trending!

[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: OK![WAIT 5] Off we go![WAIT 30] Hmm, where should we go[WAIT 5] to check the latest trends?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Good question.[WAIT 5] Let's start by asking what has been[WAIT 5] trending with the typical kind of[WAIT 5] [VAR 010E(0002)] we[WAIT 5] see around Hoenn.
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: OK, OK![WAIT 5] Let's see. When I think of a typical[WAIT 5] [VAR 010E(0002)]...[WAIT 30] That's it![WAIT 5] Of course! The one Trainer we all thought of,[WAIT 5] right? It's gotta be @s![WAIT 5] If we ask @s, I'm sure[WAIT 5] we'll be on the real cusp of cool!
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ohhh![WAIT 5] What a hip idea!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)] schools are[WAIT 5] the hottest thing around!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)] parties are[WAIT 5] absolutely on fire!

[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like [WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)] songs[WAIT 5] are definitely number one!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)] collections[WAIT 5] are having a real boom right now!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)] qualities are[WAIT 5] what's real chill these days!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like living in[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)] houses[WAIT 5] is the best symbol of status!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: So then, lemme see...[WAIT 5] I went right ahead and asked, and...[WAIT 5] It seems like making[WAIT 5] [VAR ITEM2(0003)]-dexes[WAIT 5] is what's really on fire!
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll check out one of those[WAIT 5] schools for myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of schools are they?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll have to hold one of those[WAIT 5] parties for myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of parties are they?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll try to become one of[WAIT 5] those masters myself![WAIT 30] But a master of what exactly?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll head out to visit one of[WAIT 5] those festivals myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of festivals are they?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll try out some moves for[WAIT 5] myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of dances are they?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll try my own hand at one[WAIT 5] of those songs![WAIT 30] But what kind of songs are they?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll start one of those trendy[WAIT 5] collections for myself![WAIT 30] But what are they collecting for?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll pursue that kind of quality[WAIT 5] for myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of quality is it?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll try renovating one of[WAIT 5] those houses myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of houses are they?
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: Ho ho![WAIT 5] Maybe I'll try to compile a dex like[WAIT 5] that for myself![WAIT 30] But what kind of dex is it?
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: That's what I want to[WAIT 5] know, too! Let's see for ourselves![WAIT 30] We're off for that trendy town of[WAIT 5] Dewford to find out more!
[VAR BE05(0002)]Vet MC: All right![WAIT 5] Now I'll finally be able to be as cool[WAIT 5] as @s, too!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Li'l MC: Sure you can![WAIT 5] This has been Trend Shoot![WAIT 30] I hope none of you watching miss[WAIT 5] out on the next big wave of trends![WAIT 5] See ya on the other side!
[VAR BE05(0001)]“Search2Catch”![WAIT 5] It's the program where we cover[WAIT 5] the amazing encounters that[WAIT 5] bring Pokémon to their Trainers![WAIT 30] A Trainer named @s[WAIT 5] found a hidden Pokémon[WAIT 5] in [VAR LOCATION(0001)].
I had my fingers crossed for h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer![WAIT 30] @s![WAIT 5] There's a cute Pokémon right there[WAIT 5] in front of you! Do your best![WAIT 5] Your fated encounter is waiting!
I had my fingers crossed for h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer![WAIT 30] @s![WAIT 5] There's a lovely Pokémon right in[WAIT 5] front of you! Do your best![WAIT 5] Your fated encounter is waiting!
I had my fingers crossed for h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer![WAIT 30] @s![WAIT 5] There's a great Pokémon right there[WAIT 5] in front of you! Do your best![WAIT 5] Your fated encounter is waiting!
I had my fingers crossed for h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer![WAIT 30] @s![WAIT 5] There's an epic Pokémon right there[WAIT 5] in front of you! Do your best![WAIT 5] Your fated encounter is waiting!
[VAR BE05(0001)]@s's sneaky steps[WAIT 5] were beautiful and light![WAIT 5] I think it only took [VAR NUM2(0004)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0004,0100)]s[WAIT 5] to reach that Pokémon!
@s is quite the[WAIT 5] cautious one.[WAIT 30] [VAR GENDBR(0000,0201)]HShe's taking h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]iser time[WAIT 5] to approach slowly.
[VAR BE05(0001)]But then...[WAIT 5] @s walked right on by![WAIT 5] @s![WAIT 5] Oh, @s![WAIT 5] How blind are you?![WAIT 5] Wasn't it in your field of vision?[WAIT 5] Couldn't you see[WAIT 5] that cute [VAR PKNAME(0002)]?![WAIT 5] I bet you're just the kind of Trainer[WAIT 5] who complains about how they[WAIT 5] can never meet new Pokémon![WAIT 5] I'm so disappointed!
[VAR BE05(0001)]And so @s[WAIT 5] walked on[WAIT 5] incredibly slowly![WAIT 30] One step...and then another...[WAIT 30] @s[WAIT 5] is being so careful![WAIT 5] And that's why...[WAIT 5] That's why...[WAIT 30] it got away![WAIT 5] @s looked a bit sad[WAIT 5] as [VAR GENDBR(0000,0100)]she watched the [VAR PKNAME(0002)][WAIT 5] fade into the distance.
[VAR BE05(0001)]Then a Lv. [VAR NUM3(0003)] [VAR PKNAME(0002)][WAIT 5] was encountered...[WAIT 5] The [VAR PKNAME(0002)] was driven[WAIT 5] back by a powerful attack, though![WAIT 30] Being a strong Trainer is lovely,[WAIT 5] but you end up expecting more[WAIT 5] from your opponents.[WAIT 30] Hopefully we can all find that one[WAIT 5] special Pokémon someday!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Then @s finally found[WAIT 5] that one special[WAIT 5] Lv. [VAR NUM3(0003)] [VAR PKNAME(0002)]![WAIT 5] They fell for each other[WAIT 5] the moment they met![WAIT 30] The [VAR PKNAME(0002)] looked so[WAIT 5] happy going into the Poké Ball!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Then @s met a[WAIT 5] Lv. [VAR NUM3(0003)] [VAR PKNAME(0002)].[WAIT 5] It looks like our fearless Trainer[WAIT 5] was driven back by a fierce attack![WAIT 30] Seeing @s run for the[WAIT 5] Pokémon Center was a bit sad.
[VAR BE05(0001)]Then @s finally found[WAIT 5] that one special[WAIT 5] level [VAR NUM3(0003)] [VAR PKNAME(0002)]![WAIT 5] @s ran away, though![WAIT 30] I was so disappointed![WAIT 5] Pokémon are nothing to be scared[WAIT 5] of! They're just waiting for you[WAIT 5] to approach them!
[VAR BE05(0001)]Then @s finally found[WAIT 5] that one special[WAIT 5] Lv. [VAR NUM3(0003)] [VAR PKNAME(0002)]![WAIT 5] Although the only one who[WAIT 5] thought so might[WAIT 5] have been @s![WAIT 5] That [VAR PKNAME(0002)][WAIT 5] ran away in flash![WAIT 30] Of course, I just felt so sorry for[WAIT 5] h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer that I couldn't find[WAIT 5] the words to say.

Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of Pokémon!
My name is Birch.
But everyone calls me the Pokémon Professor.
And this...is what we call a “Pokémon.”
This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon.
We humans live alongside Pokémon, at times playing together as friends, and at times helping one another out.
And sometimes, we just like to have fun battling others like us!
But as close as we are, we don't know everything about Pokémon.
In fact, there are still many, many mysteries surrounding Pokémon.
I do research to try to unravel those Pokémon mysteries. But that's enough about me!
What about you?
Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?
Will you give me your name, too?
So you're @s?
So you're @s?
Ah... I see!
You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
You're THAT @s! You're the one who's moving to Littleroot Town, where I live!
Are you ready?
Your very own adventure is now about to unfold!
Be courageous and leap into the world of Pokémon where dreams, adventures, and friendships await!
I expect we'll be meeting again soon. Come see me in my Pokémon Lab!

Mystery Gift allows you to receive great gifts through various communication modes. Once you have received a gift, please go to any Pokémon Center and pick it up from the delivery girl.

When the card slots are full, you will not be able to receive any more. Please delete some from the Album.
When you cannot receive new cards, please check the Card Album. If it's full with 24 Wonder Cards, choose a Wonder Card from a gift you've already picked up and press the A Button to throw it away. If you have gifts waiting, go to any Pokémon Center and pick them up from the delivery girl.

[VAR BD00(0008,0000,0000)]Appeal move no. [VAR NUM1(0000)]![VAR BD01] Which move will you use?
Oh! But you can't participate this turn!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] tried to show its appeal with [VAR MOVE(0001)]!
The other Pokémon used their moves.
All [VAR PKNICK(0000)] can do is watch the others.

But its appeal was jammed!
It was swept along by the other Pokémon's move.
But it failed!
It worked even better than usual!
The audience, who had been looking forward to seeing an appeal combo, had their attention drawn away!
It utilized its previous failures to do its best this time!
It can't use any more moves now!
It worked frighteningly well!
It worked as hard as the currently leading Pokémon!
Anticipation is swelling for a combo on the next turn!
It worked rather well!
It worked a little better than usual!

[~ 42]
It reduced the appeal of the other Pokémon by half!
It used all its frustration about being jammed before to really stand out this time!
It can't use any more moves to show off its appeal!
Its amazing appeal has touched the audience's heart!
[~ 47]
[~ 48]
It stood out as much as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
[~ 50]
All the Pokémon look nearly equally appealing!
[~ 52]
It became very aware of the Pokémon going on after it.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] will be unable to use any moves after this!
It is feeling pretty calm and collected now.
It is completely oblivious to the other Pokémon's moves.
It tried to startle the other Pokémon!
It tried to dazzle the audience!
The audience looked away from [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] became nervous!
It tried to unnerve the Pokémon waiting for their turns!
It tried to taunt the Pokémon that are feeling pumped up!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is no longer feeling pumped up.
The standout leader, [VAR PKNICK(0000)], really tried to show off its appeal!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] hadn't been standing out much, but really gave its all this time!
It made about as good a showing as all of the Pokémon that went before it!
But [VAR PKNICK(0000)] failed to show off its appeal!
It made about as good a showing as the Pokémon before it!
But [VAR PKNICK(0000)] failed to show off its appeal!

[VAR PKNICK(0000)] showed off its appeal fantastically well!
It was a huge hit with the audience because it was the same type as the move used by the last Pokémon!
It totally outshone the last Pokémon! What appeal!
It failed to outdo the last Pokémon. How lackluster...
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] got even more pumped up than usual!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was so pumped up that it showed off its appeal to great success!
It moved up in line so that it can go earlier next turn.
It moved back in line so that it can go later next turn.
It scrambled up the order for the next turn.
[~ 86]
The combo went over well with the audience!
[~ 88]

[VAR PKNICK(0000)] managed to avert its gaze.

[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was distracted and looking down.

[VAR PKNICK(0000)] couldn't help uttering a cry!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] couldn't help leaping up!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was distracted and tripped!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was too nervous to move!
But it failed!
But it failed to make the other Pokémon nervous!
But it failed to make any of the other Pokémon nervous!
[~ 104]
But it couldn't get pumped up...
It didn't show off its appeal well, because it couldn't get pumped up for its move...
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] was unaffected!
The audience was disappointed to see [VAR PKNICK(0000)] using the same move twice in a row.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)]'s [VAR 01A2(0002)] really excited the audience!
But [VAR PKNICK(0000)]'s show of [VAR 01A2(0002)] didn't go over very well with this audience.
The audience is completely taken with [VAR PKNICK(0000)]'s [VAR 01A2(0002)]!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] won't be able to move in the next turn!
It attracted the crowd's attention, and now no one will pay any attention to the other Pokémon's [VAR 01A2(0002)]!
The crowd can't tear their eyes away from [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)]'s [VAR 01A2(0002)] got no attention...

It's stuffed with pretty Pokémon knickknacks.
It's chock full of Pokémon books and photo collections.
Everything appears to be arranged in a very orderly fashion.
There's a ton of convenient items. They all look useful.
It's brimming with all sorts of Pokémon novelties.
Are these books for Pokémon to read?
The trash can is empty.
There's a set of Pokémon picture books.
It's packed with all sorts of books.
It's filled with Pokémon magazines! “Pokémon Pal”... “Pokémon Handbook”... “Adorable Pokémon”...
It's a vase with a simple design... You peer inside... But there's nothing in it!
There's nothing in it!
It's jammed with all sorts of Pokémon merchandise.
Is it a blueprint of some sort? It's too complicated to make sense of.
