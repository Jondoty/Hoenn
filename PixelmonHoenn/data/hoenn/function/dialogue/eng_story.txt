They say, here in Hoenn, there are places called Mirage spots. One does not simply walk into a Mirage spot. Not to mention that these places also appear and disappear mysteriously.
I've been to a Mirage spot... I'm sure of it. But I forgot where it is... I used to be very good at remembering things... I'm so shocked that I can't remember...
Mirage spots... It must be the weather conditions that seem to make them visible at some times and not others. Or are they truly appearing and disappearing?

People say they've seen a Pokémon flying high in the sky above Hoenn. Is it flying around all the time? Doesn't it need to rest somewhere?
A sky Pokémon! A sky Pokémon!
Where did you come from?
Yes? Yes Town? I've never heard of a place like that.
No? That doesn't make any sense. You have to come from somewhere. Oh! Wait! You're not going to say you were born at the bottom of the sea?
...Would you take this from me? I no longer have any use for it.
That Big Stadium over in the Unova region... I always dreamed of standing on the mound there. But no matter how much I hoped and struggled, my abilities couldn't keep up with my ambitions.

Hello, Trainer. Would you do me a favor and trade Pokémon with me? Living in Pacifidlog, I can only catch certain kinds of Pokémon. Do you have [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR PKNAME(0002)]? I'll trade you my [VAR PKNAME(0001)] for it.
Wow! This [VAR PKNAME(0002)] is so fluffy! Since we traded, you and me, we're friends, aren't we?
That's not [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR PKNAME(0002)].
I'm a little disappointed...
All right! Let's trade!

Ah! Your Pokémon...
It's clearly very friendly toward you. A Pokémon that adoring and adorable deserves a TM like this, no?
Hmm... It's not bad, but it's also not good. You, as the Trainer, need to put in some more effort.
It has a vicious look to it. A frightening Pokémon like that deserves a TM like this.

“Six dots open three doors.” Grandpa used to say that, and I was always wondering what he meant. I had no idea that it was some secret to meet special Pokémon. He told me another story, too. I wonder if this has some hidden meaning, too...
Grandpa used to say that this huge Pokémon sometimes visits our region. But you'll need to have something cold to meet it... I wonder what he meant. Ice cream, maybe?
Grandpa used to say that this huge Pokémon sometimes visits our region. He told me that it comes to visit this iceberg kind of Pokémon. I can only think of one kind of iceberg Pokémon...
Grandpa used to say that this huge Pokémon sometimes visits our region. But you'll need to have three of its friends with you to meet it... I wonder what Pokémon they are. Does it have to do with the six dots?
Grandpa used to say that this huge Pokémon sometimes visits our region. But he said you'll need to wait in the middle when it's bright and Hoenn is overflowing with natural energy. I wonder if he meant you can't meet it at night.

Pacifidlog Town floats on top of a colony of Corsola. If I told you something like that, would you believe me?
It's said that the ancestors of the people in Pacifidlog were born on their boats and died on their boats, living their whole lives on the sea. It's said that they lived that way because they were searching for something.

It's extremely friendly toward you. It couldn't possibly love you more. It's a pleasure to see!
It seems to be very happy. It's obviously friendly toward you.
It's quite friendly toward you. It seems to want to be babied a little.
It's getting used to you. It seems to believe in you.
It's not very used to you yet. It neither loves nor hates you.
It's very wary. It has a scary look in its eyes. It doesn't like you much at all.

Oh! So you did come to visit! If you're looking for Wally, though, I'm afraid he's gone. After he lost to you in Mauville, he said he had to train more, and we haven't seen him since. It must be his Pokémon that have lit such a fire in that boy and given him so much hope to live for...
Wally... I hope you're all right out there...
Is that right? Wally made it all that way on his own... He may be my little brother's boy, but I feel as proud as I would if he was mine!
Oh! You're the @s who Wally was telling me about. I'm Wally's cousin, Wanda!
Don't you worry about Wally. He'll be just fine, I'm sure. I know my little cousin, and he has his Pokémon with him, too!
Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend every day. Happy? You bet I am!
My daughter's boyfriend is a very driven and passionate sort of person. He's been digging a tunnel nonstop just so he can see my daughter. My daughter's a little concerned, so she goes out to the tunnel a lot.
It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend was digging the tunnel by hand! It's so incredible!
If anything were to happen to Wally, I would never be able to look his parents in Petalburg in the eyes...
Wally was in Ever Grande? His parents in Petalburg would be astonished to hear that!
Why, it feels like it's been ages since we saw you last!
What wonderful timing! I was thinking that I wanted to give this to you...
I didn't really thank you properly when you helped smash those rocks in the tunnel.
Do you remember how light came falling out of the sky a while ago? I found this in the yard that day. Actually, I found two, and I gave the other to Wally. It's a pretty stone, and I'm sure your Pokémon would be delighted if you let one of them hold it!

Oh, Pokémon, I adore them! It's like I feel an instant attachment... Oh my, I didn't mean to reveal that! Well, no matter. If you're entering a contest, try this move on for size.

He got abducted by some weird guys calling themselves Team Something or Other...
They say that he was just up and kidnapped by some nuts calling themselves Team Something or Other...
Those shady characters... They called themselves Team Magma.
Those shady characters... They called themselves Team Aqua.
It seems as though they plan to do something with the Meteorite that the professor has been researching. The professor is just too gullible. If you show the least bit of interest in his research, he would happily go with you anywhere, without question.
@s, please... You've got to help me save him! They can't be planning to do anything good with Professor Cozmo's research. We have to do something!
@s... I know it's a lot to ask, but we've gotta help Cozmo! I can't just stand by here and watch them use his life's work for their own corrupt reasons!
I...I'm going to head after them right away! Let's meet up at Meteor Falls!
I'm going to head to Meteor Falls right away. Come catch up to me as soon as you can.
I'm counting on you, @s!
I'm counting on you, @s!
Ahhh! Professor! Thank the stars above! Professor, you're back!
Hah...haha... Thanks to these children, I have somehow returned.
Those crazy jerks... What do you think they wanted with the professor's Meteorite anyway?
Those nuts back there... What do you think they're hoping to do with the professor's Meteorite?
I've gotta say, they sure didn't look like the good guys...but...
From the look of them, they kind of seem like bad guys, but...
I guess we'd both better be careful from here on out. Not that I'm really worried about you, @s. You and your team'd be fine for sure.

There are many books and papers about Meteorites! “Relativity of Meteorites and Energy Vol. 1: Pokémon” “Relativity of Meteorites and Energy Vol. 2: Humanity” “Relativity of Meteorites and Energy Vol. 3: Nature”
Thank you, Professor.
Wow! Thanks, Professor!
Now that that's over with... What're you planning to do next, @s?
We-e-ell... What're you gonna do next, @s?
I'm thinking of going for my next Gym Badge. The one from Mauville City.
I'm thinking of checking out the next Gym on my list. It's the one in Mauville City.
Wanna make the trip together, @s? To Mauville, that is.
Why don't you come with me, @s? To Mauville!
Ah, right. Well, tell me if you change your mind. Mauville's right in the middle of Hoenn, so you can go to all sorts of places from there. Even Mt. Chimney, the place those guys were talking about at Meteor Falls, is a pretty short trip from Mauville.
Oh. Right. Well, tell me if you change your mind! Mauville's right in the middle of Hoenn, so you can go to all sorts of places from there. Even Mt. Chimney, the place those guys were talking about at Meteor Falls, in fact. It's just a short trip from Mauville.
Cool. Let's go then.
Right on! Let's hit the road!
Oh! Why, hello again!
What good fortune... I'd been thinking that if I saw you again, I would want to give you this...
I happened to pick this up some time ago, while doing excavation at Meteor Falls. I hoped it might help you and your team along on your journey. But I'm still astounded by it all.
A relationship between the Mega Stones, Key Stones, and the Meteorites... My, but new facts do come to light every day! This is what makes my research feel worthwhile!
I know a man, a dear friend in the Kalos region, who has been researching Mega Evolution. We worked together a few years back here at Meteor Falls researching Meteorites. I'll have to share this information with him at once. It might propel his research forward, and help future Trainers and Pokémon. I hope it does.
Oh, welcome, welcome! Make yourself at home.

Eheheh. My friends and I did our best in the contest, and now for some reason I feel like I have a lot more fans!
Hmmm... I was keeping my excitement to myself until yesterday, but my Pokémon and I weren't quite good enough today! Perhaps the eyes of the judges become more discerning at higher ranks.
What's that? Is it this machine next to me that you're interested in?
I just love making Pokéblocks! In the old days it used to take four of us to make a Pokéblock with this machine.
The Contest Spectacular is held in four different contest halls all over Hoenn. You can enjoy the Contest Spectacular at any of them. I always go to Lilycove, but today I feel like a change of pace.

Hey, you were really impressed, too, right? That's what you call a Spectacular Talent! Pokémon show off their talents until the excitement in the hall is at its peak. Then their allure can't be held back and comes bursting out as a Spectacular Talent!

Oh, hello. You are?
OK, you're @s. I can see that you're a Trainer. So that means you use the Pokémon Storage System I developed. How I arrived at that conclusion is a simple deductive process. You spoke to me because you wanted to access something on this PC.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Lanette. Honestly, I'm glad to meet you. It's great you're using the Storage System. If you could, please visit me at home. My house is on Route 114.

That Charcoal I gave you is used for making herbal medicine. It can also do wonders when held by a Pokémon. It powers up Fire-type moves!
Herbal medicine works impressively well. But your Pokémon will dislike you for it. It must be horribly bitter!
The display reads: The more bitter it tastes, the better it works!

It seems to me that the more I walk with my Pokémon, the friendlier they become toward me.
I gave a Red Pokéblock to my Pokémon. It looks a lot cooler all of a sudden. Hmm... Maybe I ought to eat a Red Pokéblock.
How disappointing. Traveled all the way from Kalos dreaming of the hot springs over there... Come to find they are for Pokémon only... Sigh. It can't be helped. It seems there are hot springs in the Gym, too, so I should give them a try...
Moomoo Milk? It's great before entering the hot spring! And even better afterward. How about some?
I'll take one.
I'll take a dozen!
I'll pass.
Here's your Moomoo Milk. Drink up!
It's $500 for one bottle!
It's $6,000 for a dozen!
Well, now I feel udder-ly useless!
You don't have enough money.
You can't buy any more.
Aha! Pokémon Journal Use a Fire-type move on a frozen Pokémon, and you can melt the ice.

Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be @s? Lavaridge's Gym Leader Flannery uses Fire-type Pokémon. Her passion for Pokémon burns stronger and hotter than a volcano. Don't get too close to her or you might get burned. Hose her down with water and then go for it!
Yow! That was a scorching hot battle!

Welcome!
No, wait. I mean... Puny Trainer, you've done well to make it this far! Let's see. I'm, uh, honored to be serving as the Gym Leader of...
No, I mean... I'm Flannery, and I'm in charge here!
Uh... You'd better not underestimate me just 'cause I've only been Leader a short time!
With the skills inherited from my grandfather, I'm gonna, uh, demonstrate the hot moves we've honed in this land!
Haiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
[~ 23]
I...I've only recently become a Gym Leader. I guess I was trying too hard to be someone I'm not.
When I don't act like myself, no wonder Pokémon that battle at my side get confused.
Thank you for teaching me that. You deserve this.
@s received the Heat Badge from Flannery.
If you have a Heat Badge, all Pokémon up to Level 50, even those you get in trades from other people, will obey you completely. And it lets Pokémon use the HM move Strength outside of battle.
This is a token of my appreciation. Don't be shy about taking it!
Overheat is a Fire-type move that inflicts serious damage on the target. But it also sharply cuts the Sp. Atk of the Pokémon using it. It might not be suitable for longer battles.
Your power reminds me of someone... Oh! I know! You battle like Norman, the Gym Leader of Petalburg.

Lavaridge Town Pokémon Gym Flannery's Certified Trainers: Wally, @s
You finally became the Champion. I heard it from Winona in Fortree. The news of your success lit my fire and made me realize again that I have to grow more as a Pokémon Trainer. Thank you for stimulating my spirit!

The Sturdy Ability protects Pokémon from one-hit KO moves like Fissure! But that's not all! It also protects the Pokémon when a normal attack was strong enough to have made it faint in one blow. I want to acquire that kind of raging strength of my own as a single man!
On Mt. Chimney's peak, there's a local specialty that you can buy only there. Give one to a Pokémon—it will be elated.

@s! Wow, it's a relief to see you in one piece!
Oh, well, you know... The last time I saw you was right after battling those Team Whatsit people... So I was a bit worried, thinking about what might have happened to you after that, @s...
...What? You battled them AGAIN after that? And you BEAT them! You really are something else, @s. I-I mean, you and your team are. I'm pretty impressed by you all! And that pretty stone that's sparkling there... Is that the Meteorite you got back from them?
Oh, that's right! Here! Here! I've been thinking of giving these to you.
If you put on those Go-Goggles, you'll be all set heading into the desert on Route 111.
...Oh! And isn't that— That's Lavaridge's Gym Badge! So you beat Flannery, too? I guess you really are training your Pokémon right...
Next up will be challenging your dad, Norman, in Petalburg, right?
I'm headed to Petalburg's Gym next myself...
Do you want to go back together? Back to Petalburg?
Aye aye! Then let's hit the road!
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll still be here in Lavaridge for a while, so find me if you think you'd like a little company on the road after all.
@s, hey! So you were all right, huh?
Oh, well, you know... The last time I saw you, you were mixed up with those “Team Whatsit” people... So I just wondered if you'd gotten back on the road after that. It was, like, I don't know... I guess I was a bit...worried?
What? You battled them AGAIN after that? And you even managed to beat them? You really are something else, @s... You and your Pokémon. Your team. And that...that sparkle there... Is that the Meteorite you got back from them?
...Oh, right! I forgot to give you these before.
Keep those with you if you're planning on going into that desert near Route 111. There should be some Pokémon that only make their habitat in the desert, you know. You might check 'em out—if you're up to it.
And... Huh? You got the Lavaridge Badge! So you even beat Flannery, huh? Looks like you've been taking proper care of your Pokémon.
Guess that means...that you'll be headed to Petalburg City next, huh? To challenge your dad at his Gym?
W-well, if you are... I just happened to be thinking of going to Petalburg myself, so...
How about it? Wanna go back to Petalburg together?
Y-yeah? Then let's hit it!
O-oh... Yeah, I get it... But, well, I'll probably still be here in Lavaridge for a while. So if you decide to head for Petalburg, um, let me know.
I have here an Egg. I'd hoped to hatch it by covering it in hot sand by the hot springs. But that doesn't seem to be enough... I've heard it would be best if it were kept together with Pokémon and carried about.
You are a Trainer, yes? And your Pokémon radiate vitality. So, what say you? Will you take this Egg to hatch?
Good! I hope you'll walk plenty with this here Egg!
@s received the Egg.
Oh. You have too many Pokémon. Talk to me again when you have room for this Egg.
As you wish, then... If you have a change of heart about hatching this Egg, I will be here.
Every so often, an Egg will be found at the Pokémon Day Care. Or at least that's how the rumor goes.
Your Pokémon radiate vitality as usual. What say you? Will you take another Egg to hatch?
We draw as much hot water as we need, and yet the hot springs never run dry. Isn't it magical? These hot springs appear near active volcanoes. Veins of water under the ground are heated by magma to well up as hot springs.
I was buried in this hot sand, enjoying the heavenly warmth of a sand bath. I was just thinking I could really get used to this, when a Pokémon went and nipped my backside! Gyahhh!
Oh, you like hot springs, do you? That's surprising for one as young as you.
I bathe in the hot springs every day. I want to become a beautiful and strong Gym Leader like Flannery.
If people put Pokémon in hot springs, the results could be seriously strange. It might create a bubble bath or even a lava bath!
They're claiming that these hot springs are good to calm nervous tensions, relax aching muscles, solve romantic problems, and attract money...
Lavaridge Town Pokémon Center Hot Springs An excellent place for relaxing!

There's an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
@s slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Pokémon became visible to the naked eye!

I wrote a theme song for those [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools that are popular right now. Give it a listen! Oh! [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools! Wonderful [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools!
Hmm... You should work more on your singing than [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools.
Man, I just can't wait for the [VAR ITEM2(0000)] party! We have to have a really splendid party!
Yes, even the TV news might come to report on the [VAR ITEM2(0000)] party. It's an event with a lot of history, after all.
My big brother all of a sudden quit his job and said he's going to try to become a real [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master. What do you think? Can he make it as a professional [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master?
Hmm, I don't know. It's hard to become a professional [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master with a halfhearted effort. I think your big brother has what it takes to be a great [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master, though. I'm sure he can do it!
I saw one of those [VAR ITEM2(0000)] festivals. Jealous? The real thing was awesome!
That [VAR ITEM2(0000)] festival wasn't real! The real one is better... Prettier... Anyway, it's just really cool!
We talked about this before, but let's have a big [VAR ITEM2(0000)] dance party on this island!
Oh, good idea! We can decide who has the best [VAR ITEM2(0000)] dance moves! I'll spend all my time working on my [VAR ITEM2(0000)] dance moves from now on!
I was feeling down yesterday because I lost my wallet, but my mom cheered me up with a lovely [VAR ITEM2(0000)] song. That [VAR ITEM2(0000)] song touched my heart.
Ah, to be able to sing a beautiful [VAR ITEM2(0000)] song... Your mom must be a really good singer! I'd like to hear her sing once.
Well... [VAR ITEM2(0000)] collections aren't just a trend anymore. They feel like a part of my life now.
Is it really like that?! It's [VAR ITEM2(0000)] collections all day every day with you! You're like some kind of [VAR ITEM2(0000)]-collection professor!
If you and I team up, we'll be unstoppable at [VAR ITEM2(0000)] quality!
You said it! We'll be like Team [VAR ITEM2(0000)] Quality! Hahaha!
My dream is to save up some money to build my very own [VAR ITEM2(0000)] house in Slateport, where I've always wanted to live. Come for a visit when it's built!
Wow, if you really build your own [VAR ITEM2(0000)] house, it'll become a landmark in Slateport! Here's hoping you build a huge [VAR ITEM2(0000)] house!
Pokédexes are all right, but... I think it's [VAR ITEM2(0000)]-dexes' time now. They're worth looking into.
[VAR ITEM2(0000)]-dexes, huh? Not bad! It's thrilling to dive into a field that no one has noticed yet. [VAR ITEM2(0000)]-dexes will definitely be in great demand with Trainers.

Going against him with Normal-type Pokémon is asking for trouble. Fighting-type Pokémon will lay a serious smackdown on Normal-type Pokémon, so stay on your toes!
Hey, OK, go for it!
Whoa! It's turned too bright in here! Your future is bright, too!

I'm Brawly! Dewford's Gym Leader!
I've been churned in the rough waves of these parts...
And I've grown tough using the cave at the outskirts of this town as my training ground, as well as using the equipment in this Gym.
So you want to challenge me?
Let me see what you're made of!
[~ 19]
OK, you've got me. Take this Gym Badge!
@s received the Knuckle Badge from Brawly.
The Knuckle Badge makes all Pokémon up to Level 30, even those you get in trades, obey without question.
Hmm... You know what? I think you can make full use of this, too.
I'm sure this will help your Pokémon bulk up muscle!
Bulk Up temporarily enhances the Pokémon's muscle power. The move boosts both Attack and Defense stats of the Pokémon.
I can see your talent becoming a giant wave that causes a storm of astonishment with Trainers one day! I look forward to the day when I can surf your giant wave!
By the way, have you been to Granite Cave? It's located to the north of this town. It's full of fascinating stuff, like rare stones and wall paintings thousands of years old. My friend Steven rushed to the cave after I told him about it.

Dewford Town Pokémon Gym Brawly's Certified Trainers: @s
You defeated Steven, right? The wave of rumor hit this town, too! I didn't think you'd roll in to the Hoenn region so soon. I've got catching up to do! My Pokémon and I are working hard every day to bulk up!
Dewford Town Pokémon Gym Brawly's Certified Trainers: @s, Wally

This is a renowned fishing spot. Are you getting the itch to fish?
I hear you, and I like what you're saying! I'll give you one of my fishing rods.
And, as an added bonus, I'll even throw in a little fishing advice! First, you want to face the water, and then use the rod. Focus your mind... If you get a bite, pull on the rod. Sometimes you can snag something immediately, but with bigger catches, you need to time the pulls on your rod to haul them in.
Oh, is that so? That's too bad, then.
Yo! How's your fishing?
Great!
Not so great.
Is that right! That's great! Haul in some big ones!
Oh, hey, don't get down on yourself! I'll give you a little fishing advice. First, you want to face the water, and then use the rod. Focus your mind... If you get a bite, pull the rod. Sometimes you can snag something immediately, but with bigger catches, you need to time the pulls on your rod to haul them in.

Hi there! I work at the Poké Mart. From what I can see, you're a novice Trainer. Am I right? OK. Being super kindhearted as I am, I'm going to give you useful advice.
First of all, that's a Poké Mart there. Just look for our blue roof. We sell a variety of goods, including Poké Balls for catching Pokémon!
Potions can be used anytime, so they can be very useful to have.
Aaaaah! Wait! Please don't wander around here! I've just discovered a set of incredibly rare Pokémon prints! Wait until I finish sketching them, OK?

And this is a Pokémon Center! Look for a red roof! Ask a woman inside, and she'll restore your Pokémon's health. That's it. That was the advice from me— the supremely kindhearted clerk. Have a great journey!

Huh? You're looking for Professor Birch? The prof's away on fieldwork. Ergo, not here. Oh, I guess I have to tell you what fieldwork is? Fieldwork is when you study things in their natural environments, like out in the fields and mountains, instead of in a laboratory. The prof isn't one for doing desk work, really. He's the type who would rather go outside and experience things than read about them here. He's probably doing a survey of Route 101 now. It's just outside of the town.

So, @s! I've heard so much about you from your father. But he said that you don't have your own Pokémon yet. If that's true, that was quite the performance back there! Looks like you really are your father's son!

@s received [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
While you're at it, why not give a nickname to that [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Yup! That's the spirit! So what kind of name will you go with?
Oh, so that's how you like to do things? Not even going to give it a nickname, are you?
You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain experience, I think you'll make a pretty excellent Trainer. My girl, May, happens to be out on Route 103 right now, surveying Pokémon for me. It might not be a bad idea for you to head out that way yourself. What do you think?

Oh, don't be that way! You should go meet my kid.
Oh, yes! And if you're ever lost along the way, use the AreaNav on your PokéNav Plus! You can use it to see how to get to Route 103, where May ought to be. And if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest back at your new house.

So I hear you beat May on your first try. That's amazing! May's been helping with my research for a long time, so she has a pretty long history as a Trainer already. Mm-hmm! I think that settles it! @s, I ordered this Pokédex for my research, but I think you should take it.

@s received a Pokédex!
That Pokédex is a high-tech tool that automatically makes a record of any Pokémon you meet or catch. My girl May takes hers with her everywhere she goes. Whenever she catches a rare Pokémon and records its data in the Pokédex, why, she comes to seek me out wherever I am in the field and show me!

The Pokémon and people you will meet... And the great expanse of nature that lies before you! Experience them both while you fill in your Pokédex. I'd love it if your world seemed wider than ever! Though I'd love it even more if you came back from time to time to show me what progress you've made. ...Arghhh! I'm getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!
Oh, wow, @s! Now you've got a Pokédex, too! That's great. Just like me! Then here... I'll give you something, too! Some Poké Balls that you can use to catch wild Pokémon!
If you catch a Pokémon in the wild and battle together with it for a while, it will grow stronger for you! Take that as a bit of advice from a more experienced Trainer like me! I'm going to get ready to head out from Littleroot soon myself. I can't wait to see what kind of Pokémon I'm going to meet... Let's both do our best on our journeys, @s!

I wonder where I should go to look for Pokémon next?
Huh... So you got a Pokédex, too, @s. Well then here. Have some Poké Balls on me. You can use them to catch wild Pokémon.

It's a serious-looking machine. A detailed list of Pokémon that inhabit the Hoenn region is displayed on the map.
It's a PC used for research. On the monitor is an image of a never-before-seen Pokémon. Better not mess around with it.
There are still some notes written in neat handwriting in the notebook that's been left wide open! “Could it be that several thousand years ago the Pokémon population of the Hoenn region was even more diverse?”
“The History of the Hoenn Region,” “The Ecosystem of Pokémon 3,000 Years Ago,” “The Pokémon of Kalos and Hoenn,” “The Coexistence of People and Pokémon,” “Distribution of Pokémon Species, National Edition.” There are a lot books written by Professor Birch here!
Welcome back, @s! You must be tired after all your recent exploits. May has been keeping me updated about all of your grand adventures around Hoenn. After hearing all that you've been up to, there is something I'd definitely like to share with you.
Welcome back, @s! You must be tired after all your recent exploits. Brendan has been keeping me updated about all of your grand adventures around Hoenn. After hearing all that you've been up to, there is something I'd definitely like to share with you.
The fact of the matter is that after you resolved that kerfuffle with the super-ancient Pokémon, a number of Pokémon never before recorded in the Hoenn region began to appear all over! Those Pokémon are precisely the subject of my many long years of research... They are Pokémon which are thought to have resided in Hoenn thousands of years ago!
We'll finally be able to meet Pokémon never before seen, the very Pokémon I've pursued all these years! I'm so excited I feel like I'm about to burst! So excited that I went right ahead and upgraded the Pokédex to be ready for all of them!
Now, let me upgrade your Pokédex while you're here!
The National Pokédex has now been added to @s's Pokédex!
You'll now find the National Pokédex on your Pokédex's menu, so use it well!
It is being suggested that Hoenn is now more hospitable to Pokémon after that incident in Sootopolis. However, that does not necessarily mean the environment has become any more hospitable to humanity. People, Pokémon, and nature... The balance between these three great ecosystems has shifted greatly. I can't wait for you to start exploring this new world! Exploration may help us learn how best to coexist with Pokémon from this time forward. I hope you will find your own answers to this great question, as you continue your journey with your Pokédex!

@s! You're here at last! Wasn't it tough riding in the back of the bumpy moving truck all that way? Well, this is Littleroot Town. What do you think? This is going to be our new home! It has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should be a nice place to live, don't you think? And you get your own room this time, @s! Come on. You have to see the inside!
@s! Wait!
@s! @s! Did you introduce yourself to Professor Birch? Oh! What an adorable Pokémon! You got it from the professor? How nice! You are your father's child, all right... You look good together with a Pokémon!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
... To think that you have your very own Pokémon now... Your father will be overjoyed. But don't push yourself too hard. If anything happens, you can always come home, honey.
To think that you can get data from the friends you pass by even when your Nintendo 3DS is in Sleep Mode! The power of science is staggering!
Professor Birch will spend days on end in his lab researching something, then he'll suddenly go out into the field to gather more data... When does he ever spend time at home?
If you step into the tall grass on the route up ahead, wild Pokémon will jump out at you!
It's not safe to go out there if you don't have any Pokémon with you.
I think I hear someone screaming up ahead! What should I do? What should we do? Somebody has to go help...
Boy, am I glad there was an intrepid guy like you around to rescue the professor.

Mrrr...
OK, I know, I know. I'll leave it alone. Look, I'm stopping!
But this sure is a ni-i-i-ice place, isn't it? Littleroot Town. And everybody living here is just so ni-i-i-ice, too. Like that neighbor of yours.
...Oops! So-o-o-rry. I didn't mean to go on like that. We should keep our first meeting short and sweet, don't you think? Until next time, then. Buh-bye!
Well... Bye then...
Well... Bye...
...
...
@s!
@s!
See you tomorrow!
See you tomorrow!
You're back at last! Welcome home, @s!
H-help me!

It's an Azurill Doll! It has a familiar smell...

Oh... It's you. How about it? How's the old S.S. Tidal treating you? I can tell from the sea breeze on my skin that my old friend has still got it.
Guh!
Glug!
Could you scoot over a bit more? You did say you wanted to sit in a seat on the deck...
Such an elegant moment as I gaze out upon the interminable sea... My Slakoth is pleased, too, so I'm glad I brought it along!
There's a weird old guy at the front of the bow...
There was a big Wailord breaching just now! Oh! By the way, breaching is what you call it when a Wailord or a Wailmer jumps as high as it can for everyone on the ship.

We will be landing in Lilycove City shortly. Thank you for sailing with us. When you get off the ferry, please speak to the crew at the entrance.
It'll be some time before we make land, I reckon. You can rest up in your cabin if you'd like. Your cabin's No. 2. The bed in there is soft and plushy. I can attest to how comfy it is!
We've arrived!
Go visit other cabins. Trainers bored with the boat trip will be itching to battle.
Enjoy your cruise!

I'm known as the Day Care Man. I help take care of the precious Pokémon of Trainers like you. If you'd like us to raise a Pokémon for you, have a word with my wife.
Why, you again! Good to see you back. Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]'s doing fine.
Good to see you back! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. Those two seem to get along like a house on fire.
Good to see you back! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. Those two seem peaceable enough toward each other.
Good to see you back! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. But I have to say, those two don't seem to like each other all that much.
Good to see you back! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. Those two would really rather play with other Pokémon, though, and not each other.
Ah! You're back! We were raising your Pokémon and, me oh my, were we surprised! While we were caring for it, your Pokémon somehow found an Egg! Don't know where it might've come from, but your Pokémon ended up with it. You'll be wanting it, won't you?
@s received the Egg from the Day Care Man.
Be sure you take good care of it!
You've got no room for an Egg now... Come back when you've made some space.
I'll take it off your hands, then. Be honest—you do want it, don't you?
Well then, I'll be having this one! Thanks!
I'm the Day Care Lady, dearie. We can raise your Pokémon for you here at our Pokémon Day Care. Would you like us to raise one?
I'm the Day Care Lady. We can raise your Pokémon for you here at our Pokémon Day Care. What can we do you for today?
Righty-oh. Come again.
My husband was looking for you, you know.
If you leave me that Pokémon, what will you battle with? Come back when you have more of a team.
Which Pokémon shall we raise for you?
Oh... That is naught but an Egg!
Righty-oh. We'll raise your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] for a while.
Come back for it later, though.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon. Would you like us to raise one more?
Oh, so you've come again! You have mighty spirited Pokémon, you know. Are you here to take one back?
Well, we've raised your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] up by about [VAR NUM2(0001)] level[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s.
If you'll be wanting your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] back now, it will cost you $[VAR NUM5(0001,002C)].
Oopsie! It looks as though your purse is a little light at the moment...
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] took back h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR PKNAME(0000)] from the Day Care Lady.
You wanna take the other one back, too?
Oh me... If you leave a Pokémon with me, you'll be left with only the one. You'd better go catch some more before you try such a thing.
Oh me, your Pokémon team is full up! Make room, and then come see me again.

Would you like to give a nickname to the newly hatched [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?
Hi, I'm the Day Care Lad! It's my job to help take care of other Trainers' precious Pokémon. If you want us to raise your Pokémon, please go inside and talk to my big sister.
Hi there! [VAR PKNICK(0000)]'s doing just fine!
Hi there! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. They really seem to like hanging out!
Hi there! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. The two seem to get along all right.
Hi there! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. But they don't seem to like each other very much...
Hi there! Your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine. Seems they'd rather play with other Pokémon— not so much with each other.
Oh hey! When we were raising your Pokémon, something amazing happened! It somehow ended up holding an Egg! I have no idea where it came from. It's like a total mystery! You've gotta want it, right?
@s received the Egg from the Day Care Lad.
There you go! Take good care of it!
Ah! You've got a whole team already! There's no space for this Egg now. Why don't you deposit one of your Pokémon in the PC to make space?
If you don't want it, I'll keep it! But you've gotta want it, right?
Really really? Well... I'll keep it, then! Thanks!
Welcome to the Pokémon Day Care. We're happy to raise your Pokémon here! Would you like to entrust us with your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Day Care. We're happy to raise your Pokémon here! How can we help you today?
Come again, then!
My little brother has been looking for you! He's probably out front. Go see him!
If you let me take that Pokémon now, you'll have no one left to battle with! I just can't let you do that!
Which Pokémon should we raise for you?
I'm so sorry, but we aren't set up to raise Eggs here...
Got it! We'll raise your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] for a while.
You can come and pick it up anytime!
We can take up to two Pokémon per Trainer. Would you like us to raise another?
We've had a great time with your Pokémon, but are you here to make a pickup?
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] has grown by [VAR NUM2(0001)] level[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s during its stay with us.
If you're going to collect your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] now, you will owe us $[VAR NUM5(0001,002C)]. Is that OK?
Oh, you don't have that much money...
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] took [VAR PKNAME(0000)] back from the Pokémon Day Care.
Do you want to collect your other Pokémon now, too?
Oh! If you leave a Pokémon with me, you'll be left with only one! I just can't let you do that!
Your team is all full, so I can't return your Pokémon to you. You could drop one off in a PC Box to make space.

Would you like to trade Poké Miles for prizes?
PokéMileage is the service that allows you to collect miles when you trade Pokémon. The number of miles you can earn depends on the distance between regions registered on the two Nintendo 3DS systems. You can also collect a small number of miles by walking around the Hoenn region. To view your current miles, please check Poké Miles on your Trainer Card.

Enjoy your Secret Base life!
Anything more?
[VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0000)]! How many will you take?
So it'll be [VAR NUM2(0001)] [VAR ITEM2(0000)]! That's $[VAR NUM7(0002,002C)]. Sound OK?
So it'll be [VAR NUM2(0001)] [VAR ITEMPLUR1][VAR ITEM2(0000)]! That's $[VAR NUM7(0002,002C)]. Sound OK?
Thank you, thank you!
Even if you buy that many, you can't fit them all in the PC, you know!
You're too short on cash!

Looks like that won't fit in the PC!
Sorry, friend! You don't have enough cash!
Give up on learning the move [VAR MOVE(0001)]?
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] did not learn [VAR MOVE(0001)]!
Ah... Well, I can't actually teach any moves to an Egg, see...
You're good with having it forget [VAR MOVE(0000)]?
1, [WAIT 20]2, and[WAIT 20]... [WAIT 20]... [WAIT 20]... Ta-da![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR BE05(0005)] [VAR PKNICK(0000)] forgot how to use [VAR MOVE(0002)]. And...
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] learned [VAR MOVE(0001)]!
Do you want me to teach any other moves?
@s sent the [VAR 01A6(0001)] to h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]iser Secret PC!
Oho. Looks like your Pokémon already knows that move.
Ahhh... Looks like your Pokémon can't actually learn that move.
Then I'll take the BP. Thanks for the business!

Mmm-mm. I can smell it. I can smell it right here... The scent of adventure! This is definitely one. It's gotta be a Secret Spot. There'll be enough space here to build a crazy super place, or my name's not Aarune!
Yo, my young Pokémon Trainer! What can I do you for, hmm? Huh? What d'you mean, you didn't ask for anything? Bet your heart did! Now, now, no need to be shy! After all, we managed to meet! The name's Aarune. Put'er there. Unova-born, and twenty-five years old. Spent the last 11 years trying to find myself. Just a vagabond in search of dreams. I'm wandering 'round Hoenn, trying to find a place where I really belong. That's right! A Super-Secret Base!
You don't know about Secret Bases? What kinda life is that? Too sad, little [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0303)]brosis. Time for a little lecture from Uncle Aarune! Let's start with what a Secret Base is... Which is adventure! Romance! Awesome! For real, it's the best place ever to chill— you, your pals that you let hang out... Since you've got this chance, you oughta learn how to make one. Take this.
Secret Power can help you find the entrances to hidden places. These entrances... They're full of adventure, all right! That's why I like to throw some spice in there and call 'em Secret Spots!
Like this! See? This right here is a Secret Spot. Doesn't it look like you could just climb right up in this tree? This is exactly the kinda place to bust out with Secret Power!
Awww yeah! I never get tired of that! And that's all there is to finding Secret Spots and creating the entrance to a Secret Base. This move is crucial to having a Secret Base. Don't forget, now!
Mm-hmm! Not a bad layout... See, behind each Secret Spot, you'll find a space like this. They come in all kindsa shapes and sizes. So basically, whenever you find a Secret Spot, you oughta at least check it out with Secret Power!
Just think... Someday this place could be somebody's Secret Base, all decorated and filled with goods and friends... I'd really love to see it like that.
Wait a sec... But who in the world are you? ... Ahhh! Right! @s! Sorry about that. I just got on such a roll... So then, @s! How about I give you one more tip? When you feel happy about something, you oughta express that feeling. Put it into words! It'll cheer everybody up.
So how 'bout you tell me, huh? C'mon. Tell Uncle Aarune what you say when you're totally thrilled!
Whistle... [VAR 01A9(0001)]? That's good! Know why I asked you that? Isn't it obvious? It's 'cause I can see already that there's plenty in your future to feel happy about!
That's just how we roll in the Secret Base life. Every day is full of happy adventures! Aw yeah!
Hmm. Now I could go ahead and make a Secret Base right here, but... I get the feeling that this layout could be even better for you, little [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0303)]brosis! Guess I'm gonna leave this spot for you!
Oh, right. Decorating! See, any Decorations you get will be sent to the PC in your Secret Base automatically. Place 'em around and liven up your base a bit.
That there's a PC! That's where you'll find your Decorations. Not that you probably have much, right? Here, I'll give you these to get ya started!
Oh, RIGHT! One last thing! You can do more than make your own Secret Base. You can visit other people's bases for a bit of fun. If you find a base that belongs to someone else, check it out. And here's the real point. When you check out someone's base, collect the flag you find next to the PC. Heh heh... Something good might come of it!
Looks like it's about time for me to hit the road in search of my perfect base! Good-bye for now, but hopefully I'll see you again, @s. If you need me for anything, try dropping in at the Secret Base Guild in Fortree!
This will be your Secret Base from now on, little pal! It's yours now, so decorate it, destroy it, do whatever you want! Whatever floats your boat, right?
@s received Decorations from Aarune! @s sent them off to h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Secret PC!

@s: Looks like you don't have your own Secret Base set up yet...
@s: Do you need something?
@s: I once found a good spot around [VAR LOCATION(0002)], but someone else had taken it. I gave up on it at the time, but maybe it's open now...
@s: I once found a good spot around [VAR LOCATION(0002)]... but [VAR TRNAME(0003)] had gotten to it first!

@s: Good battle! Come play again sometime!
@s: Come back tomorrow!
@s: Hmm... I don't know what it is, but I don't really feel like battling today. Can we do it some other time?
@s: No, no, this is no good! You don't have enough Pokémon to battle!
@s: When your party is ready, just let me know!
It's like you can hear Aarune himself... “You've gotta have a Secret Base of your own before you can get any Secret Pals!”
It's like you can hear Aarune himself... “Uh-oh, pal! Looks like there's no room left on the Welcome Mat in your base!”
@s: [VAR 01AA(0007)]! [VAR 01AA(0007)]! I'd be delighted, [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!
@s became one of your Secret Pals!
@s: Oh, don't tell me... You like this place, don't you?

You received [VAR NUM3(0003)] flag[VAR NUMBRNCH(0003,0100)]s from @s!

Let's battle!
Show me a special skill!
Let's say good-bye.
Nothing.

@s: This is a pretty sweet base! Now that we've become pals and all, I really want to do something you can only do with a Secret Pal, you know?
@s: That's it! I just thought of something good! Let's make our own team! That's settled! We're doing it! But we've got to have a name first. [VAR TRNAME(0002)], what kind of name do you think is good?
@s: Yeah? Team [VAR 01AA(0007)], huh? Team [VAR 01AA(0007)]! Team [VAR 01AA(0007)]!!! [VAR 01A9(0006)]! It has a nice ring to it! That'll be our team name from now on! Next we've gotta think up a slogan! Let's pick a slogan for Team [VAR 01AA(0007)]! What would be good?
@s: Hmm, hmm, hmm. [VAR 01AA(0001)], huh? [VAR 01AA(0001)]! [VAR 01AA(0001)]!!! I've gotta drum it into myself so I don't forget it! Oh, yeah.

@s: That's one finely shaped Egg. OK! Here I go...
@s: There, there... Good Egg... That's a good little Egg... Yes, you are. Yes, you are a good little Egg! [VAR 01A9(0002)]! [VAR 01A9(0002)]! ...

@s: [VAR 01A9(0006)]! Berry detected! Berry detected!
@s: I bet I know where they will be today. OK! Here I go...
@s: Millions of stones, stones for me... Sparkle-ee sparkle, sparkly sparkle... Millions of stones, stones for... Hmm? Isn't this... No way?! ...
@s: [VAR 01A9(0006)]! This is... Uh, what kind of stone is it?

@s: [VAR 01A9(0006)]! I found some FANTASTIC treasure!
@s: Which Pokémon would you like me to massage for you?
@s: It doesn't look like [VAR PKNICK(0004)] needs any massaging.
@s: Yeah, that's an Egg.
@s: Oh, so clenched! Feel these knots? OK! Here I go...
@s: Knead...knead... Thump, thump, thump! Knead, knead... Thump, thump, thump! [VAR 01A9(0002)]! [VAR 01A9(0002)]! ...

@s: Which Pokémon should I do some exercising with?

@s: What kind of exercise should I do?
HP exercises
Attack exercises
Defense exercises
Sp. Atk exercises
Sp. Def exercises
Speed exercises
Never mind
@s: Come on, let's do this together! Here we go...

Oh! A customer! Welcome to the Inverse Battle Stop!
What I have to offer here at the Inverse Battle Stop is a positively miraculous form of Pokémon battle! That's right... I call it the Inverse Battle! This precision machine, this envisioned contraption can use its inversion powers to temporarily invert all type matchups between Pokémon! It's the Inverse-o-matic! Super effective becomes not very effective! Not very effective becomes super effective! How about that! You have to admit that it sounds pretty fantastically fun, don't you? Don't you? You might think you've got your head wrapped around it, but when you're actually in the thick of it, it's surprisingly tough! So how about it?
If you've come to visit my humble storefront, then you must be ready for an Inverse Battle!
Super effective becomes not very effective! Not very effective becomes super effective!
You came all this way...to turn back now? But I'll be waiting for your return!
Oh, yes! Oh, just as I would expect! You are a true habitué of the Inverse Battle Stop! I've got a little gift for such a great regular. Here! Take it!
Oh, yes! Oh, just as I would expect! You are a true habitué of the Inverse Battle Stop! I've got a little gift for such a great regular. In fact, I've got three!
Ohhh! Excellent! Just excellent! You have perfectly understood the beauty of the Inverse Battle! I've got a little something for an opponent like you! Here! Take it!
Ohhh! Excellent! Just excellent! You have perfectly understood the beauty of the Inverse Battle! I've got a little something—three little somethings, in fact—for you!
Nice! Very, very nice! You've learned quite a bit about the beauty of Inverse Battling, hm? I've got a little something for an opponent like you! Here! Take it!
Nice! Very, very nice! You've learned quite a bit about the beauty of Inverse Battling, hm? I've got a little something—three little somethings in fact—for you!
Nice! Very, very nice! You've learned a fair bit about the beauty of Inverse Battling, hm? I've got a little something for an opponent like you! Here! Take it!
Nice! Very, very nice! You've learned a fair bit about the beauty of Inverse Battling, hm? I've got a little something—in fact, three little somethings—for you!
Nice job! Though I think that you haven't quite grasped the trick of Inverse Battling. Still, I'll give you a little something, so be sure to come try again!
Nice job! Though I think that you haven't quite grasped the trick of Inverse Battling. Still, I'll give you these, so be sure to come try again sometime!
My fantastic Inverse-o-matic is indeed a revolutionary device that can temporarily invert all type matchups. But I can't just fire it up again and again, you know. Do you think you could come back tomorrow?

Hullo, hullo, and welcome. I hope you meet lots of Pokémon!
As you explore, you may see some litter here and there. Sometimes you can spot Poké Balls that have been lying around for years. No one has ever come to claim them, and we'd collect them for recycling anyway, so feel free to pick them for your own use.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 137
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are both rare Pokémon and common Pokémon to be found here, but I hope you'll love them both the same. OK?
I'm in charge of keeping the Pokémon well fed around here. I dole out a set amount at a set time every day.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's my job to go about checking up on the health of all the Pokémon. Having so many Pokémon together in one area means we have to be extra careful of the spread of illness.
You know, we call this place the Safari Zone, but it's really no different than any wild area. There are no cages or walls. The Pokémon are free to come and go as they like.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 139
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Are you catching Pokémon here in the Safari Zone? That's fine as long as you take care of them!
We're all volunteers around here. That's what you've got to do when you don't charge for admission!

A mysterious ring is floating in the air. Something is visible deep in the hole...
Would you like to put your hand deep in the hole?
A mysterious ring is floating in the air...
[~ 3]
Very clear sea water is quietly surging...
A blazing and strong presence is in the air...
You feel an intense gaze almost electrifying your entire body...
Cold air like the north wind sweeps over the area...
Fresh air surrounds the area. It's clearing your head...
Clear air surrounds the area, making you feel strong.
Clear air surrounds the area. It's lifting your spirits...
The area is filled with a calm atmosphere.
It's so hot that you can't stop sweating... Merely breathing is difficult...
The area is filled with electrifying pressure...
The area is filled with blazing pressure...
The area is filled with freezing pressure...
You feel a piercing gaze sizing you up...
You feel a strong gaze and like something is calling for you...
You feel a quiet gaze...testing you...

I can tell exactly how strong you are and how a battle between us would go... just by lookin' at you! It's eerie, right? Now stand back and watch as I battle you within my mind!
... Yowza! You did me right in! Take this, and have mercy!
Phew... That was bad. So eerie. I couldn't even get a hit in on you! Seriously, tell me: What are you?

So, you've come, @s.
As you can see, I have undone the seal on the entrance to the Sky Pillar. Follow the path within, and you will reach the pillar in time.
However... To go beyond this point... There is one more trial you must overcome.
This is my duty as one of the ancient Sootopolitans, a duty passed down to me by my former master.
You must battle me. Here and now. Prove to me that your power is great enough to face what lies ahead!
Now tell me... Are you prepared?
I see. I will wait. Prepare yourself.
Then let us begin... Champion of Hoenn. You, who should exhibit the most graceful of art in battle with your Pokémon... I would have you show me your true strength!
As I have come to expect from you, @s... You are an excellent Pokémon Trainer.
As I have come to expect from you, @s... You are an excellent Pokémon Trainer.
The Pokémon that you sent out in that battle... At times dancing as lightly as an elusive spring breeze... Yet striking with the sudden surety of lightning from the blue. Watching you command the battle with such ease and grace... Even I might succumb to your charm.
Now go forth. Find the truth that you seek.
As one of the ancient people of Sootopolis, I cannot intrude upon this holy place. I will return to Sootopolis for now and try to lay plans in case the worst should come to pass despite all our efforts. I'm sorry that we always seem to be leaving the fate of all the world in your hands. Yet there it lies once again. Good luck to you, young Champion!

This... This is...
How awful...
... I... I only wanted...
I wanted to make...a world where Pokémon could live on...in peace... Where...that...Pokémon...
Archie...
Is this... Is this the power of the super-ancient Pokémon? Is this what Kyogre's power truly is? Is this how you return everything to its beginning?
The balance in this world is faltering. At this rate, it may be lost forever.
You... We will make our way to Sootopolis. It is most likely the case that Kyogre is also making its way to that city.
In the deepest reaches of the Cave of Origin, which lies in the heart of Sootopolis City...
That is where Kyogre will find the energy it needs to reclaim its primal form.
I expect Kyogre will go to that place in search of even greater power. We must follow it to the Cave of Origin and do whatever it takes! There's nothing else we can do!
Archie. You and your team of fools will accompany us.
We have brought this calamity upon ourselves. It is only right that we take responsibility and clean up after our mistakes.
Ugh!
Let's go, Archie!
...
This... This is not...
What...
... I... I wanted... I wanted to make...
It was supposed to be a world where the human race would attain new heights... The next stage...of our development... It was all...for humanity's future...
Boss... Maxie...
So this...is the power of the super-ancient Pokémon... This is how Groudon brings everything to an end...
All of us, people and Pokémon... Every living thing on this planet... Everything's gonna die...
OK, little scamp... We're setting sail for Sootopolis. That blasted Groudon is no doubt gonna get there ahead of us.
It'll be waiting for us deep in the Cave of Origin, there in Sootopolis...
There's a pool of energy there that folks say is needful for Primal Reversion.
There's no doubt in my mind that Groudon will be racing to that cave, thirsting for that power... We got no choice but to go ourselves. We gotta do whatever we can to fight back!
All right, Maxie! You Team Magma blighters better come with us.
We're responsible for this mess. This ridiculous, impossible mess. It only makes sense for us all to step up and clean up after ourselves. Agreed?
Ngh...
Let's go. Boss Maxie...

@s!
@s!
I'm sorry I could not be here sooner.
Terrible... So this is what was being depicted in that painting in Granite Cave.
If this doesn't stop, all Hoenn— no, the entire world—will drown. Nothing could live in such a world— neither humans nor Pokémon!
If this doesn't stop, all Hoenn— no, the entire world—will burn up. Nothing could live in such a land of death—neither Pokémon nor humans!
This huge rain cloud... Is it spreading out from Sootopolis?
This dreadful blaze... It must be caused by the sweltering heat wave forming above Sootopolis...
Come on, Steven... Think! What are you going to do?
... ...No.
There's no point in agonizing over the situation from here... I have to go to Sootopolis. There must be answers there.
@s...

I will count on you to help with this crisis... But...please... Promise you won't do anything reckless.

But I must ask for your assistance. Won't you help us avert this crisis? If we work together, I believe we'll be able to overcome this ultimate threat. I will expect your arrival in Sootopolis.
Hey, little scamp. Look, I'm supposed to be a grown-up, right? So let me say sorry for the way this has gone down.

There are all sorts of fishing rods lined up!
Welcome, welcome. This here is 123 Go Fish. And that Poochyena you see there is our “watch Pokémon,” Chomper. Chomper's a real glutton, all right. Puts everything in that mouth. If you feel like fishing, though, you're free to fish your heart out in that pond out front.
Play along with an old man, would you? Tell me which Pokémon you like best.
That won't do... No, not at all. It's like you know nothing.
Oh, exactly! You get it, don't you? I'll have to give you something special I've been holding onto!

Hello, and welcome to the Safari Zone! Admittance is free! Catch all the Pokémon you can! Enjoy yourself with Pokémon for as long as time allows!
I met this little rascal here, and now we're just like family!
Guhbeh!
Are you going to the Safari Zone? Then you'd better take either an Acro Bike or a Mach Bike!
There's a book called “The Path of the Safari Zone.” It looks long, but do you want to read it?
Chapter One: Foundation. “A desire to provide the children of the Hoenn region with a chance to encounter many Pokémon welled up inside of me and led to my decision to open here.” Chapter Two: Opening. “From the very day we opened, a long line wound its way from the Safari Zone. It was a huge success. A desire to make more money off of it welled up inside of me and led to my decision to raise the price of admission.”
Chapter Three: Bankruptcy. “As a result of the higher admission prices, customers stopped coming to the Safari Zone. A desire to save my own hide welled up inside of me and led to my decision to flee under cover of night.” Chapter Four: Rebirth. “After I had made my escape, the Safari Zone was reborn thanks to the support of some thoughtful people. A desire to pretend that I had never run away welled up inside of me and led to my decision to return to Hoenn.” Final Chapter: The Future. “Having made my return, I began working as a volunteer at the Safari Zone. A desire to express my happiness at having returned welled up inside of me and led to my decision to continue to take good care of Pokémon every day.”
That look in your eyes... And the aura floating about you... You're one of my kind, aren't you? You make all kinds of mischief, right? If so, you'll really like this!
Maybe it's 'cause I was so naughty in the past, but lately I don't feel refreshed when I wake up. Then I taught this to my Pokémon, and now all my bad dreams get eaten up!

Welcome to the Safari Zone! Enjoy yourself as much and for as long as you would like!
I don't want to go to Mt. Pyre or anything... I just want to cuddle with Pokémon in the Safari Zone...
Mt. Pyre, huh... Whenever I go there, I always feel like there's someone—or something—brushing against me... But there's never anything there...
...You need something? Could you not get in the way when I'm trying to seriously commune with my Pokémon here?
Our leader Maxie's vision will bring new hope to all of humanity. ...Not that it's anything a child like you would be able to understand.
Pwump!
Pwhine...
I don't want to go to Mt. Pyre or anything... I just want to cuddle with Pokémon in the Safari Zone...
So people and Pokémon and everything have the oceans to thank for being alive? Sure, that's what Archie said, but... Do you figure it's really true?
Arghhhh! Nooo! You little—! Would you stop marking everything? Where do you learn these things!
I first met this Pokémon when I was in basic training to join Team Aqua. Back then, this little fellow got me right in the legs with its Bite and I was knocked down flat! Of course I still have him test me every day, five times a day!

Just...what... is this... D-d-did Leader Maxie know that it would happen like this?!
Could it be? Is this the world... Archie hoped to create...
Curse you! The precious results of my research! GIVE THEM BACK!!!
Oh, shut it!
Shut your mouth!
Augh?!
Steady on! Are you all right?!
Just what is going on around here?! Ahyahya! Even I, Tabitha, am feeling all discombobulated. Leader Maxie! What are you trying to do?! ...To the world. ...To us. ...To Team Magma. This can never, ever be forgiven!
Fine, I'll give it back. I'll give it back, all right? The awakening of the super-ancient Pokémon will bring about extreme weather. If this happened all over the world, what would become of Pokémon, not to mention people?
Ahya. Are you one of my fans? You're that same kid who's always popping up! I can't believe you're even following me around in my private life.
Oh my! I even run into you when I'm not on the clock! I wonder why that is... Maybe we're destined to be together... Ahaha!
Ahyahya! Well, that's all right! Maybe I'll just clear up this intensely unpleasant feeling I have welling up inside of me... By beating you to a pulp!
Wanna know something? I'm feeling so empty and downhearted right now. I can't get my head straight. Umm? Help me take my mind off it. The way you and your Pokémon battle so straightforwardly and sincerely with such hope, it makes me so mad!
Hah... Hah... Ahya... Ahya...
...
Good grief... Today has been absolutely nothing but stress! I can't take it... It's so unpleasant!
Hmmph. I feel a bit more relaxed... Thanks.
You better listen, you stress-inducing child. When Leader Maxie's plan has been executed, twilight will fall upon the world. The Primordial Sea will be changed to Desolate Land. In other words, all life... Child! What do you think you can do in the face of that which is to come?
As a token of my gratitude, I'll tell you one thing. When Team Aqua's... No, when the illustrious Archie's ambitions have been realized, the world will truly return to its beginnings, to before the birth of anything at all... Think for yourself about what to do when you're up against that reality. I still haven't figured out for myself what's wrong and what's right...
I'm looking forward to seeing you rush into action! Ahya! Ahyahyahyahya!
See ya. I'm sure I'll run into you again, though.
The Leader should be headed for Mt. Pyre... Which means I...
Archie is probably on the way to Mt. Pyre... So I...
Thank you, young one. You helped save us from quite a pinch!
You OK there, mate?
Hah... Hah... That truly was a slap in the face...
Those thieves... What could they hope to gain by investigating the extreme weather patterns of thousands of years ago?
Oh, but I am forgetting myself! First I must thank you properly for your help.
It might seem an odd way of rewarding you, but please take this Pokémon as my thanks.
Hmm? You cannot carry any more Pokémon with you currently. Why don't you come to call again after you've made space on your team?
@s received Castform!
Castform is a Pokémon that changes its form according to the current weather conditions.
We have many of them living here in the Institute with us. They help us with our research of weather phenomena.
Indeed. I trust that it might help you on your adventure.
But as for the data those ruffians were seeking... They wanted to know about the extreme weather conditions that ruled thousands of years ago because of those two super-ancient Pokémon.
One of that pair was the Legendary Pokémon we know as mighty Kyogre... By absorbing the energy that abounds in the natural world, Kyogre transformed itself—or so it is said. The transformed Kyogre caused so much disturbance to the weather patterns that the world was assaulted by torrential rains, and the seas rose around the planet. We refer to this transformation as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion... Its result is the terror we call [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Kyogre. Primal Reversion is a possible form of Evolution, like and yet not like Mega Evolution... Or so it has been theorized. But it has never been achieved by any Pokémon other than the super-ancient Legendary Pokémon, and so it has been largely forgotten as a method of Evolution.
One of that pair was the Legendary Pokémon we know as mighty Groudon... By absorbing the energy that abounds in the natural world, Groudon transformed itself—or so it is said. The transformed Groudon caused so much disturbance to the weather patterns that the world grew barren. The heat it created dried up the oceans, and the parched land covered more and more of the planet. We refer to this transformation as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion... The result of it is the terror we call [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Groudon. Primal Reversion is a possible form of Evolution, like and yet not like Mega Evolution... Or so it has been theorized. But it has never been achieved by any Pokémon other than the super-ancient Legendary Pokémon, and so it has been largely forgotten as a method of Evolution.
If you'll excuse us then... We'll be heading downstairs now, but talk to us when you have a moment. We want to thank you as well.
I've been researching rain for many years, but it's ridiculous to think that humans can freely change the weather.
I would still like to thank you somehow for your help. I hope you'll take this Pokémon for your team.
We have many Castform living here in the Institute with us. They help us with our research of weather phenomena.

There are a number of documents explaining meteorological studies.
It is a document detailing the extreme weather patterns brought about by the super-ancient Pokémon, Kyogre. “By absorbing the abundant energy of the natural world, Kyogre transformed itself and summoned forth greater storm clouds than ever before witnessed.” “An endless deluge of rain fell from the storm clouds, prompting floods so terrible that it seemed the entire world would sink beneath the seas.” “This transformative process, known as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion, turns Kyogre into the fearsome [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Kyogre.”
It is a document detailing the extreme weather patterns brought about by the super-ancient Pokémon, Groudon. “By absorbing the abundant energy of the natural world, Groudon transformed itself. In its transformed state, it expelled waves of heat into the heavens above.” “This heat wave burned as brightly as another sun, prompting droughts so terrible that it seemed the entire world would be left shriveled and barren.” “This transformative process, known as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion, turns Groudon into the fearsome [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Groudon.”
Would you like to give a nickname to Castform?

I thought how you fly is by catching a whole flock of bird Pokémon, and then hanging on to them somehow. But it turns out there's an HM move called Fly! I don't know... In a way, my dream came true, but I also feel like I lost my dream... It feels really strange...
Tch... It's no good... When I ride a Bike in the tall grass, nobody can see my coolness.
Can your Pokémon use the move Secret Power to make a Secret Base out of a big pile of grass?
Do you use Detector Mode in the DexNav? Apparently, the more you encounter the same Pokémon, the better the search function will be! Its accurate search capability allows you to find rare Pokémon. They say you can find Pokémon with strange moves or rare Abilities.

@s! Gosh, where have you been hiding? I've been looking all over for you!
Oh... Where did you get that thing on your wrist? That's a pretty fancy-looking bracelet...
... Wow! So that's a Mega Bracelet? And you can use it for Mega Evolution... I guess now you can keep getting even closer to your Pokémon, huh? Some guys have all the luck...
But I'm not about to lose to you and some accessory! Let's see who's best in battle!
Are your Pokémon all ready? Of course they are! Let's go!
[~ 5]
Hm! Well, you did battle me like I asked, so I'll give you a reward.
If you use Fly, your Pokémon will carry you back to anywhere you've been before. But you must have the Gym Badge from Fortree City to use Fly outside of battle. That's the most important bit, so don't forget!
Maybe you should Fly home and visit Littleroot sometimes. I bet your mom worries about you, @s...
Well, till we meet again! And next time I won't lose!
@s! You've been looking for Pokémon here?
Huh? That bracelet you've got on... It's like, I don't know, really cool...
... Whoa. So that's the Mega Bracelet? And you can use it for Mega Evolution... So you'll just keep getting closer to your Pokémon and getting even stronger...
All right, then. I guess I've just gotta help you test how strong you've become, huh? Show me in battle how much better you've gotten!
Come on! A battle! I'm challenging you to a battle!
[~ 15]
I'd say you're good enough to search for Pokémon anywhere by now. Here, I'll give you this, so try it out. You should be able to use it fine.
With Fly, your Pokémon can carry you back to just about anyplace you've visited before. Of course, you'll need the Fortree Gym Badge first, though...
Well, I'm going on ahead. But I'm definitely winning next time!

We met in Granite Cave, didn't we?
No, I remember it. It's @s... Right? It's good to see that your journey is going well.
No, I remember it. It's @s... Right? It's good to see that your journey is going well.
You know, @s...
You know, @s...
In this vast world, there are many kinds of Pokémon. They come in many types.
Should you raise different types? Or will you only raise Pokémon of a certain type you like?
I wonder what you think, as a Pokémon Trainer?
Not that it's anything I should be concerning myself with... But somehow I find myself wanting to know what you think.
I suppose I should be going. I hope to see you again though.
...Hm?
Hyahhn!
Shwahhn!

Hyaahh!

Do you...want us to soar somewhere with you?
@s.

Come with me.
Latias... I believe that it sought us out for help.
Latios... I believe that it sought us out for help.
If that's the case, let's go!
So we've come back here... When you're ready to return to Southern Island, come tell me.
Are your preparations complete?
I see. I'll be waiting here.
Thank you for your help, @s.
Thank you for your help, @s.
Hyan!

Perhaps it's trying to tell you to take good care of Latios.

In the end, you were a far greater help than I expected you might be.
I expect that you and your team will be able to best both Route 119 ahead and even the Fortree Gym beyond that.
I'll be curious to see how much stronger you might grow by the next time we meet.
Until then, @s.
Until then, @s.
Where are you going? I don't think we can walk away from this.
Hyaahh!
Shwaahh!
Hmm! A Good Rod is really good! Wouldn't you agree?
Hmm! We're of identical minds! Hmm! Take this Good Rod!
Wherever there's water, try your luck at fishing.
Don't you like to fish?
Try catching all sorts of Pokémon with your Good Rod.
Even if there isn't a boat, you can cross rivers and the sea if you have a Pokémon that knows Surf. Pokémon can be counted on to do so much!

Thanks to that Aarune dude, I've been awakened to the adventure that is building a Secret Base. He said he would be waiting for me with the Secret Base Guild, but Fortree City is far away.
Hmm...but... I'm not sure what it is, but... But I just have this feeling...
My intuition has often proved correct. And now it is telling me that... You may wish to make some space in your PC Boxes before we set out. Just trust me on this.
Pokémon that swim with elegance in the vast ocean are nice. If you have the move called Surf, you can swim with the Pokémon, too!
Sometimes Pokémon hide underwater, too. Do you want me to show the trick to finding them?
All right, all right. I'll teach you everything I know! If you take too much time, they'll run away, so you can't dawdle! ... Oh, should I do it? Should I give away the most extraordinary technique I know?!
All right then! This is my most treasured technique. It's about watching the Pokémon closely! Pokémon hiding underwater seem to play by coming to the surface in the places they like in order. Just when and where they will come to the surface... Being able to figure that out is the most important technique of all!
Oh dear! How rude of me! You've got a look on your face that says, “I've known that for a long time!”

That Rusturf Tunnel there... At first, we had a huge crew working on boring through the rock with the latest machinery. But we had to stop. Turns out we would have had a negative effect on wild Pokémon in the area. So we're left lazing around here doing nothing!
There's a man who dug his way to Verdanturf all by his lonesome. He was desperate to get through. He says that if you dig little by little without using machines, you won't disturb Pokémon, and you'll avoid harming the natural environment.
To get to Verdanturf without using this tunnel, you'd have to cross the sea to Dewford, sail on to Slateport, and then travel through Mauville.
Did you hear? The tunnel to Verdanturf has gone through! Sometimes, if you hope strongly enough, dreams do come true.

Ohhh, what am I to do? We were just out on our walk, Peeko and I, when we were attacked by an odd thug... And then the scoundrel made off with my darling Peeko! Where are yooouuu?! Peeeeeeko!
Grrrrrr! I want to dig that tunnel!
Grrrrrr! What's going on? I was digging the tunnel without any tools when some goon ordered me out!
That tunnel's filled with Pokémon that react badly to loud noises. They could cause an uproar. That's why we stopped using heavy equipment for tunneling... I'm worried that the goon will do something stupid and startle the Pokémon into an uproar.
Grrrrrroar! That goofy goon hightailed it out of the tunnel! I can go back to digging!
Oh! It's you!
You're that Trainer who helped me in Petalburg Woods and also got back my case that was stolen and then graciously delivered it to Slateport! Captain Stern informed us that the case arrived safely! I thank you very, very much. If I were a rain cloud, I would shower you with gratitude and hail you as a hero[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0300)]ine!
For you, most wonderful Trainer, I bear good news! Recently, our company developed a new kind of Poké Ball. As a token of our appreciation for all your help, we would like to give you one!

Oh! @s! I'm sorry everything is so cluttered. When I get engrossed in research, things end up this way. This is embarrassing—please keep this a secret in exchange for this.
[~ 1]
It's Lanette's research notes. There's information about Boxes. Design Boxes to hold 30 Pokémon each. Each Trainer should be able to store 900 Pokémon on the PC system. Keep reading?
A marking system should be added to make organizing Boxes easier. The name and wallpaper design of each Box will be made changeable. Keep reading?
When storing a Pokémon, it should be sent to the Box inspected last. If that Box is full, the received Pokémon is stored in the next Box. In other words, when a Box is examined, it is automatically selected as the Box to which Pokémon are sent.
@s closed the notebook.
There's an email from someone on the PC. “... Your Storage System is quite convenient. It has a lot of user-friendly features that make it fun and useful, too. It makes me proud that I played a part in its development. Here's hoping that you'll continue research in Storage Systems. ...”
Complicated math formulas are displayed on the monitor.
Something that looks like letters is written on it, but it's so messy and not legible.
Oh, @s. You want to organize your Boxes in the PC more efficiently, don't you?
Oh, I see. I thought it was a simple deduction.
That's what I thought. How I arrived at that conclusion is a simple deductive process. ...Just because you took the trouble to talk to me.
Then please wait for a while.
It's done. I set up “Organize Boxes” at the top of the menu in the PC. If you want to return it to normal, please talk to me again.
Oh, @s. You want to return the order of the menu in the PC back to normal, don't you?

But the Fossils around here all belong to me... None for you... If you can't go without a Fossil, try the desert on Route 111... From what I've heard, the Fossils buried in the sand sometimes rise to the surface due to sandstorms...
You found a Fossil, didn't you? That's so nice... It's so dreamy... What are you going to do with that Fossil you found? From what I've heard, Devon has been researching how to restore Pokémon from Fossils... But I love my Fossils, so I would never do anything like that.
Fossils are so...wonderful... So dreamy... What are you going to do with that Fossil of yours? From what I've heard, Devon has been researching how to restore Pokémon from Fossils... But I love my Fossils, so I would never do anything like that.
Oh, don't say that! Please. I'm begging you!
No matter how many times you come and ask me, no means no! I keep telling you Fossils around here all belong to me. Besides, what's up with your attitude? Is that how you ask a favor?
I know I'm asking the impossible, but please! Oh, I can specially give you a Stone Badge... ...Oh! What am I saying? No, no way! There's no way I would use a Badge entrusted from the Pokémon League for such a purpose... Ah...but...I want... I really...want the Fossil.
Why are you arguing with yourself? It's not a Fossil. I don't want such a thing. Besides, you're a bit of a stone maniac yourself, aren't you? If you really want a Fossil, you have to find your own territory. Dig and find Fossils by yourself, like Devon's president's kid, rich or not.
Sob...sob...
What? You're crying?! Well, I don't mind you crying, but please don't let your tears drop anywhere. 'Cause the moisture and salt content in tears may have adverse effects on Fossils.
Sob...sob... Sorry. I'm ashamed of myself. You're absolutely right... I was behaving like a spoiled child... Now, I'll excuse myself...
Oh my. She's still wet behind the ears... I hope she'll grow into a great stone maniac someday...
Looking at your white Pokémon reminds me of the Devon president's son. I heard he traveled all the way to Kalos, crossing three oceans to find the white Pokémon and some kind of stone. That's what you'd expect from someone who calls himself a wandering stone collector.

Grumble... What happened to the others who went to Fallarbor? They're late...
Grumble... I'd like to ride the Cable Car to the top, too..
Grumble... You two never cease to complain... Grumble...

Eh, I'd like to get to Mauville, but if I went down these ledges, it'd be no easy matter to get back to Lavaridge.
Mt. Chimney Cable Car A short walk this way! ↑
Mt. Chimney For Lavaridge Town or the summit, please take the Cable Car.
Route 112 ← Lavaridge Town
Ah!
@s!
Look! Right up there! That's Mt. Chimney!
It sure is big... No, more like huge... It totally takes my breath away! I'd love to take the Cable Car all the way up to the top someday...
Hm? Hey, @s, don't your Pokémon seem a bit ragged around the edges? Here, let me give them a little boost!
Your team's health was restored!
Here! Take this, too!
I bet you can find all kinds of ways to use it in the mountains that lie ahead! But it won't work outside of battle if you don't have a Badge from Lavaridge Gym.
Gasp! What am I doing nattering away here? I'm supposed to be on my way to Fallarbor to visit Professor Cozmo!
I'm off for now, @s, but let's battle next time!
Hm?
So it's you, @s.
You see that mountain up there? That's Mt. Chimney.
I dunno, but... But seeing it for real is, like... Like a punch in the gut, you know? Hope I might get to take the Cable Car up to the top someday...
Hey, @s, doesn't your team seem a bit worse for wear? Here. I'll help them out for you.
And why don't you take this?
I bet you can find all kinds of ways to use it in the mountains that lie ahead! Oh... But it won't work out here if you don't have a Badge from Lavaridge Gym.
Bah! This is no time to be giving you tricks! I'm supposed to be heading to Fallarbor to visit Professor Cozmo right now!
See you later, @s. Next time let's have a battle, OK?

Oh, dear me. Aren't you and your Pokémon exhausted! You ought to stop and rest a bit here. Yes, indeedy. That's exactly what you should do.
That's right. Take your time and rest up!

You're the first Trainer I've seen deploy Pokémon with such mastery. But I should warn you—my son is stronger than you. He even challenged the Pokémon League, I'll have you know!
Our family uses this Macho Brace to strengthen our Pokémon more effectively during their training. You may not need it, considering that you beat the whole lot of us, but I hope you'll accept it anyway!
When it comes to Pokémon battles, we're pretty passionate!
Mom is stronger than Dad. I'm stronger than Mom. And Grandma's stronger than me! But my big brother is even stronger than Grandma is!
There's no question that you're strong. But if you ever battle my grandson, you'll end up crying in frustration. He's stronger than any other Trainer we know!
My grandson must be challenging the Pokémon League Champion by now. Knowing my grandson, he could be the Champion already! Ee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

Is that so? Stop by again if you change your mind!
That's the spirit! I like you!

Hey, all! I've found a pretty strong Trainer!
My goodness! Aren't you young? You must be quite the Trainer to beat my husband, though. Now I suppose it's my turn to battle!

You're stronger than Mom? Wow! But I'm strong, too! Really! Honestly!

If you're not in any hurry, visit with us awhile.
If you don't raise your Pokémon some more, it may be tough to keep winning through the ranks. I've heard the Pokémon League's Elite Four are far stronger than any Gym Leader.
I challenged the Winstrate family, but four matches in a row is tough going... They destroyed me.

Trainer Tips One indicator of a Pokémon's potential power is its Sp. Atk stat. Sp. Atk stands for Special Attack. It affects the strength of special moves. Likewise, the Sp. Def or Special Defense stat protects against special moves!

You can protect yourself from all kinds of stuff with Safety Goggles! Even though these things that I'm wearing look like glasses, they're actually goggles, too!
How did you manage to climb your way up here? Did you use a strange power like me, I wonder? ...You rode a Mach Bike up here? It wasn't some strange power? Do you think I could ride one, too?
I'm in pretty good shape, so maybe I'll try riding one of those Mach Bikes, too.

Bravo! Splendid showing! Your love of cycling comes from deep within your heart. You've shaken me to my very soul!
Your technique is remarkable. I suggest you slow down just enough to avoid collisions.
I would consider you a work in progress. Still, I hope you don't forget the sheer pleasure of cycling.
My word... Your cycling skills border on terrifying. Most certainly, you need much more practice riding.
I am aghast... You're perhaps not cut out for this unfortunate cycling business. You ought to give serious thought to returning that Bike to Rydel.
This is the Cycling Road. If you ride from Mauville to Slateport on a Mach Bike, you can be rated for your collisions and your total time.
Regardless of the results, I count on seeing more challenges from you. Always aim higher!
On this Cycling Road, folks riding Mach Bikes are rated on number of collisions and total time. Acro Bikes do not qualify for rating. They are easy to turn, so it's not fair.
Learning techniques will make Bike riding even more fun. There are some places that you can reach only by using a Bike technique.
Oh, hey, you got that Bike from Rydel! Oh, it's glaringly obvious. It says right on your bike...

Team Magma's activities must be kept secret for now.
If our members in Slateport do well, the next destination is Mt. Chimney. I have to jot it down.
This is my first job after joining Team Magma... I'm nervous.
Team Magma's actions should put a smile on everyone's face. Maybe... Perhaps...
You want to know about Team Aqua's activities? Hahaha! It's a bit too difficult for kids to understand them.
I wanted to go to Slateport and kick up a ruckus! Well, that's OK. I'll make up for it by getting all fired up in Mt. Chimney!
This is my first job after joining Team Aqua. I've got the shakes!
Team Aqua's actions will put a smile on the face of every Pokémon!
Hey, @s! It's been ages! Nice timing, too. I was just searching for Pokémon, you know?
My dad is always going on about how nature used to be even more diverse, way back in the day. He says that there used to be way more kinds of Pokémon than there are now! So that's why we do fieldwork, him and me. We really want to find out what happened to those Pokémon in the past.
On my journey up to now, I've met a lot of different Pokémon, and I think I've gotten to understand a lot of them, too. Me and my Pokémon have really grown. So...
How about a little battle?
[~ 12]
@s, you've been busy training, too, haven't you?
Oops! But look at us! Our teams look pretty tired. Let's get them taken care of first.
And now I think you deserve a reward, too! Here, this is from me!
That's a Dowsing Machine. Try it out—if there's a hidden item anywhere near you, that little thing will react to tell you. Pay attention, and it'll lead you right to items! And it's fun to see all those waving bits above your head. Try it, and I bet you'll be hooked! Careful—you won't be able to sneak up on Pokémon while you wear it!
See you later then, @s! Let's meet again!
I hope we'll both be able to meet even more Pokémon on our journeys!
Hey, @s. So this is where you've been. How've things been going? I was just checking out the Pokémon around here to help with my dad's research. He says that a long, long time ago, nature used to be way more diverse and there were lots more kinds of Pokémon, too. My dad and I want to learn more about those Pokémon from the past, you know? That's why we do fieldwork. And this journey has really helped. I've met a lot of Pokémon on my way here and learned about them, too.
Which reminds me! Come on! It's the first time we've met in ages, so let's have a battle! Show me what you and your team have accomplished on your journey, @s!
[~ 21]
Sheesh, @s, when did you go and train your Pokémon up that well? It's, like, I don't know... It's pretty surprising, OK!
Both our teams look pretty wiped out after that, huh! Here, let me help them out.
And this is for you.
That's a Dowsing Machine. Use it to root around for items that aren't visible. If it senses something nearby, it'll react, see? Truth is, once I started using it, I got pretty hooked on it. It's addicting! But I recommend you give it a try. Careful though, you won't be able to sneak up on Pokémon while you wear it!
I guess I'm off to get started surveying the next area then. I hope you meet a lot of Pokémon, too, @s!
Which should I choose? Make a beeline for Mauville on the Cycling Road, or take the low road and look for Pokémon?
I don't have a Bike, so I'll take a leisurely walk on the low road.
The two roads, one above, one below... A road each for people and Pokémon. Perhaps that is right and fair.
Wouldn't it be great to ride a Bike at full speed on the Cycling Road?
Route 110 ↓ Slateport City

Route 110 ← Route 103
Route 110 ↑ Mauville City
Trainer Tips You can immobilize the opposing Pokémon by paralyzing it or causing it to sleep. It is an important technique for Pokémon battles.
Trainer Tips The order of items can be changed by pressing START on the Bag menu.
Three steps → and two steps ↑ to reach the wondrous Trick House.

Let's keep going through Route 110 and head for Mt. Chimney!
It'll be quite a long journey. Let's take a rest in Mauville City, which is on the way.
I concur!
Let's keep going through Route 110 and head for Mt. Chimney!
Wow, that's quite far. Why don't we take a rest in Mauville City. It's on the way.
Great idea!

Yo, Trainer! Whether you're hot to trot or cool cat not, chill at my papa's spot!
Little kids can dart around so quickly... You don't dare take your eyes off them for an instant. It's very taxing. Mine's with my Pokémon, so he should be OK, but...
Our sand castle's taking a long time to make.
You can have this!
You can have this!
We're going to get all the sand from the beach and build a humongous castle! And then we're going to be the queen and king. You can be a servant.
We're going to get all the sand from the beach and make a ginormous castle! And then we're going to be the king and queen. You can be a servant.
The water around these parts is clean. But my Zigzagoon still picks up litter from the shoreline at times. Dirty water becomes rain and joins our rivers, which we drink from... If we pollute the sea, it all comes back to haunt us eventually.
Goon goon?
Seashore House May hot battles rage on hot sands! The place for hot Trainers!
Trainer Tips Pokémon at the same level may not always have identical stats. Pokémon raised by Trainers are said to grow stronger than wild Pokémon.

Mr. Briney lives in that little cottage there, beside the sea. He was once an amazing sailor who never feared the sea, however stormy.
Ah, the sea. I wonder what it's like at the bottom of the sea.
If you're going to throw a Poké Ball, weaken the wild Pokémon first. It'll be easier to catch if it's been poisoned, burned, lulled to sleep, or suchlike.
You're no better than a thief if you try to steal someone else's Pokémon. You should only throw Poké Balls at wild Pokémon you encounter.
Oh no, I'm not a Trainer! But it's true that Trainers locking eyes is basically an invitation to battle. If you don't want to battle with people, try to stay out of their line of sight!

I kept encountering the same kind of Pokémon. Then the DexNav got better, and now I can find rare Pokémon easily.
My Pokémon is staggeringly tired... I should have brought a Potion.
Will you give him one of your Potions?
What?! Th-thank you!
What?! Th-thank you!
@s handed the boy a Potion!
Thank you so much! Thanks to you, my Pokémon made a complete recovery!
Hoh hoh hoh hoh! My pretty Peeko's as full of energy as usual!

Hello! This is the Pretty Petal flower shop. Spreading flowers throughout the world!
Your name is? @s. That's a nice name.
Your name is? @s. That's a nice name.
@s, would you like to learn about Berries?
@s, would you like to learn about Berries?
Berries grow on trees that thrive only in soft soil. If you take some Berries, be sure to plant one in soft soil. A planted Berry will soon sprout, grow into a plant, flower beautifully, and then grow Berries again. I want to see the whole wide world filled with beautiful flowers. That's my dream.
Please help me, @s. Plant Berries, and bring more flowers into the world.
Please help me, @s. Plant Berries, and bring more flowers into the world.
Flowers bring so much happiness to people, don't they?
Hello! Flowers will bloom beautifully and bear many Berries if you take good care of them. You'll like tending flowers, I'm sure. You can have this.
While Berry plants are growing, water them with the Wailmer Pail. Oh, another thing. If you don't pick Berries for a while, they'll drop off onto the ground. But they'll sprout again. Isn't that awesome? It's like they have the will to live.
I'm trying to be like my big sisters. I'm growing flowers, too! Here you go! It's for you!
You can plant a Berry to grow more Berries, or you can have a Pokémon hold it. But now there's a machine that mixes up different Berries to makes candies for Pokémon. ...I want some candy, too.
Flowers of various colors are blooming. They smell wonderful...
Select “Berries” on your AreaNav, and you can check the places where you planted Berries.
And when the Berry plants sprout Berries, Berry symbols will be shown on the Berry list on your AreaNav. So I recommend you check it often.

Wassup! I like to shout my lungs out! It feels so good! You can have this, so you try it out! Use it on a Pokémon, and it will learn a move that attacks with its voice. If the move is used several times in a row, it becomes more powerful!
A word of advice! A TM, or Technical Machine, can be used many times. It won't go away. So try it out as many times as you want!
This flower shop started selling potted plants recently. It made me so happy, I went overboard shopping. I don't need this White Herb anymore. Would you take it, please?
This flower shop started selling potted plants recently. It made me so happy, I went overboard shopping. Where should I put them?
If you see Berries growing in soft soil, feel free to take them. But make sure you plant a Berry in the same spot. That's common courtesy. Here, I'll share this with you.
The way you look, you must be a Trainer, no? Trainers often make Pokémon hold Berries. It's up to you whether to grow Berries or use them.

Trainer Tips There are pairs of Trainers who challenge others for two-on-two Pokémon battles called Double Battles. In a Double Battle, the Trainer must send out two Pokémon, the ones at the top left and the top right of their list. Pay attention to how you array the Pokémon in your list!

Let's see... On Route 103, I found this Pokémon... and this one...and this one, too...
Oh! Hey, @s!
What's that? Oh! My dad gave you a Pokémon as a gift, huh?
Well then, why don't we go ahead and have a quick battle? I'll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is really like!
[~ 4]
[~ 5]
Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on you now. I mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you've already got that strong of a bond.
I bet you could probably befriend any kind of Pokémon you meet!
Phew... I guess I'd better head back to the lab!
OK, so it's this one and that one that live on Route 103...
Huh? Hey, @s!
Ohhh. So you finally got a Pokémon from my dad? Then how about a little battle? Since we're here and all!
I'm going to teach you what being a Trainer's all about!
[~ 13]
I think I know why my dad had his eye on you now.
Look, you just got your Pokémon, right? And you already have that strong of a bond? I get the feeling that you could befriend any Pokémon, @s. No doubt.
Well, I've got some good data here, so I guess it's time I got back to the lab. You should head back, too, @s!
“Press the Circle Pad slowly to sneak close to Pokémon.” “Pokémon are less likely to find you while you're sneaking up on them.” The book Professor Birch wrote— “The Fieldwork 101” said so!

Ah!
Look! Up there! Check 'em out, @s!
Those were...Beautifly, weren't they? I'll have to check in my DexNav later to be sure!
But, wow, we already made it through Route 102, huh? I guess it's really true that time flies when you're with a friend!
Oh, l-look! There's Petalburg already!
@s, your dad... He's the Gym Leader in Petalburg City, isn't he?

Whew... I went into the tall grass to survey wild Pokémon when I was suddenly jumped! You saved my hide. Thanks a lot!
Oh? But you're Norman's boy, @s! I didn't even realize who you were at first. You've grown into quite the young man. This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.
Oh? But you're Norman's girl, @s! I didn't even realize who you were at first. You've grown into quite the young lady. This isn't the place for a chat, though. Come along to my lab.
If your Pokémon get tired, take them to a Pokémon Center. There's a Pokémon Center in Oldale Town right close by.
Wild Pokémon will jump out at you when you're walking in the tall grass. So dive right in when you're trying to find that Pokémon you want to catch!

Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Good evening! Welcome to the Pokémon Center. Would you like to rest your Pokémon?
OK. I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds, then.
Thank you for waiting. We've restored your Pokémon to full health.
We hope to see you again!
[~ 6]
Happy birthday! Please keep visiting the Pokémon Center for many years to come! Now, would you like to rest your Pokémon?

Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center. Here we restore your tired Pokémon to full health. Would you like to...
Th-that Trainer Card! That wonderful shade! That sparkle! I've seen several Trainers with Silver Trainer Cards already... But you're the first to top them all with that impressive Trainer Card. Oh, @s, may I please heal your Pokémon?
Great to see you, @s! You want the usual, right?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected with the Pokérus. Little is known about the Pokérus, except that it is a microscopic life-form that attaches to Pokémon. While infected, Pokémon are said to grow exceptionally well.
Happy birthday to you, @s! It's your special day!
I'm wishing from the bottom of my heart that this will be a wonderful year for you!
Oh, @s! Today is a special day! I know it's a day early, but happy birthday to you!

Hello, hello! I am the official Name Rater! I can more or less tell your Pokémon's fortune by its name. Want me to rate the nicknames of your Pokémon?
Which Pokémon's nickname should I rate for you?
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)], is it? You picked quite a fine nickname. But I think we could give it something even better. What do you say?
I see! What would you like the new nickname to be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon will be known as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]! You're right, that does seem to fit it better. Nicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you change your mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon will be known as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]! It looks no different from before, but we both know this name is vastly superior! How fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)]! That is a truly impeccable nickname! I can't say anything bad about it! Take good care of [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!
Now, now... That is merely an Egg!

Latios... It's beautiful... If I were to describe such beauty in terms of a stone, it would be a Water Stone. No... It goes beyond that... Isn't its brilliance like that of a Dawn Stone? It is as fantastic as a Steel-type Pokémon...
Latias... It's beautiful... If I were to describe such beauty in terms of a stone, it would be a Sun Stone. No... It goes beyond that... Isn't its brilliance like that of a Dawn Stone? It is as fantastic as a Steel-type Pokémon...
Hm?
Team Magma, is it? So Latios noticed their coming, and that is why it called on us.
Team Aqua, is it? So Latias noticed their coming, and that is why it called on us.
Huhn?! What's this?! You?!
Huh?!
Mr. Matt, sir! That pipsqueak over there is the kid that I heard keeps getting in our way!
B-but that rather alluring gentleman with h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer... Oh, I feel like I should know him from somewhere... Maybe he's a contest star?
Oh ho! I have no time to worry about that! The name's Matt! That's Team Aqua Admin Matt to you!
[~ 10]
What I want from you is that Latias behind you there.
But that Mega Stone... We of Team Aqua are definitely gonna need the transcendent power of Mega Evolution to achieve our ambitions.
How 'bout it? If you get out of our way, we won't rough you up.
I'm not moving!
Go right ahead.
That's right. Full points for the correct answer!
Hmph! It's good that you feel up to joking, but this is no laughing matter.
I'll take part in this battle as well.
Let's protect Latios from these beasts together. We cannot allow Latios or even a Mega Stone to fall into the hands of such villains!
Let's protect Latias from these beasts together. We cannot allow Latias or even a Mega Stone to fall into the hands of such villains!
Oh ho! If you're really that stupid, then I have no choice but to squash you!
Eeep?!
Oh ho! Strong, ain'tcha?
You're an interesting punk, too, I'll give you that!
I love interesting, strong dudes! That's why I love my bro, Archie! And that's why I'm gonna start loving you from now on, too! Next time I see you, I'll smash you up real good, OK?
Let's get outta here, you dull Grunt!
Y...yes...sir...
Hah...
Good work, @s.
Good work, @s.
You performed spectacularly. We were able to protect both this wondrous Pokémon and its Mega Stone, thanks to you.
And it looks as though Latios may have also recognized you as a Trainer worthy of its trust.
And it looks as though Latias may have also recognized you as a Trainer worthy of its trust.
Look. It's trying to offer you its allegiance. I believe it is trying to show that it wants to go with you on your journey.
Go on. Hold out your hand to it.
Latios joined your team!
Latias joined your team!
You should take this from me...
With the Mega Bracelet that I just gave you and the Mega Stones that a Pokémon may hold, your Pokémon will be able to achieve a powerful boost, quite unlike any usual form of Evolution... but only if you are bound by great affection. You will be able to achieve Mega Evolution. I suggest you try it with Latios the next time that you happen to have the chance in battle.

Mega Evolution is a phenomenon that has long been shrouded in mystery. What is a Mega Stone? What is a Key Stone? The process by which bonds between Pokémon and people manifest in tangible power... How do we explain that?
If that settles that... Should we be heading back? Together with Latias, waiting so patiently for us there...
If that settles that... Should we be heading back? Together with Latios, waiting so patiently for us there...
All dreams are but another reality. Never forget...
... Who are you?
Hah?!
M-Mistress Courtney! That pipsqueak over there is the kid that I heard keeps getting in our way!
But that enviably unruffled-looking fellow there with him... Hm. I feel like I ought to know him from somewhere... Maybe he's a contest star?
Yes.
For the time being...get away from me.
The Pokémon behind you... Its Mega Stone... No more...no less. That is what... That's what we of Team Magma seek.
How about it? Will you get away from me... or not?
I won't!
Sure. Why not?
... Well then...
Puyah?!
As anticipated.
Unanticipated.
You. Target lock...completed. Commencing...experiment. You. Forever. Aha... ♪
Returning home.
W-wait for me! Courtne-e-e-y!
Shwahhn!
Hyahhn!
Latios is staring steadily at @s...
Latias is staring steadily at @s...
Hm? There's something on the ground here...
You seem to remember Steven warning you about something... “Do not be hasty in your excitement. You may wish to organize your PC Boxes before we set out. Just trust me on this.” ... That's right! Time to organize your PC Boxes!
Would you like to give a nickname to Latios?
Would you like to give a nickname to Latias?
You'd like to nickname it [VAR PKNICK(0000)]?
Are you sure you don't want to give it a nickname?
Your party is full! Please select a Pokémon to send back to your PC Boxes.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is carrying a piece of Latiosite!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is carrying a piece of Latiasite!
I hope that the Mega Bracelet I just gave you might bring us one step closer to finding the answer to these questions.
Ah, that's right. We should first heal up the Pokémon that fought on our behalf, shouldn't we?
Your team's health was restored!
Deleting...

We've arrived.
Thank you, Latias.
Thank you, Latios.
... I don't know what it is...
Not quite unease, not quite fear... But there is something...unsettling...
It is an odd feeling, as though I am walking in a dream— or an illusion.
I once heard an odd fable. It was said that the two Pokémon that live on this island guard some secret about that great form of Evolution: Mega Evolution. Could it be that some dangerous element is here because of that? ... Come, we should be going.
What is it you want to do? Would you like to return to Route 118 for a time?
I understand.
Latias, if you would oblige...
Latios, if you would oblige...
In that case... Shall we go see once and for all whether there is anything to be found on this island?
Now then... Shall we go see once and for all whether there is anything to be found on this island?

Aye aye. Let's be off then.

I am researching Pokémon Fossils here.
You have a Fossil, don't you? Shall I restore it for you?
What's this? You seem to have plenty of Pokémon with you already. Are you still sure you want me to turn your Fossil back into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I restore for you?
OK, then! I'll turn that [VAR ITEM2(0000)] back into a Pokémon for you!
Oh, you'd like to keep it as a Fossil? I understand.
I'm working to turn your Fossil back into a Pokémon right now!
I restored the Fossil you gave me, turning it back into a Pokémon! This is [VAR PKNAME(0001)]! Please take good care of it.
[VAR TRNAME(0002)] received [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Would you like to give your new [VAR PKNAME(0001)] a nickname?
Oh, I'm sorry. You have no space for it. I will take care of this Pokémon for now, but please come back to pick it up later!
If you have a Fossil, bring it to me!

You can call me the Judge. Heh heh, that's actually not my real name, but it's what everyone calls me. It's because of this weird power I have. It's a gift, really. I can discern—or judge, you might say—the overall potential of individual Pokémon. How about it? Let me judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon!
Hey there! So how about it? Are you gonna let me judge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon?
...Oh? You don't need me to judge? I get it.
Judge an Egg?! That's a tall order even for me!
I see, I see... This Pokémon's potential is decent all around. That's how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see... This Pokémon's potential is above average overall. That's how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see... This Pokémon has relatively superior potential overall. That's how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see... This Pokémon has outstanding potential overall. That's how I judge it, anyway.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its HP.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its Attack stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its Defense stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its Sp. Def stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its Speed stat.
But its Attack stat is good, too.
Hmm. And its Defense stat is good, too.
Although its Sp. Atk stat is equally good.
Its Sp. Def stat seems just as good, though.
And, well, its Speed stat is good, too.
It has rather decent stats, I'd say. That's how I judge it.
It's definitely got some good stats. That's how I judge it.
This Pokémon has some fantastic stats. That's how I judge it.
Stats like those... They simply can't be beat! That's how I judge it.
But its HP... It's pretty dismal, you know?
But this Attack stat... It's terrible...
But how can you make it through battle with this kind of Defense stat?
But this Sp. Atk won't even leave a scratch on an opponent...
But this low of a Sp. Def stat is going to leave you high and dry...
But you won't get anywhere fast with this low of a Speed stat...
And that's quite a disappointing Attack stat there, isn't it?
And that Defense stat is nothing to write home about, you know?
And I'm afraid that its Sp. Atk is pretty bad, too...
And it looks like it's no great shakes when it comes to Sp. Def either...
And that Speed stat... Well, it's nothing to brag about, that's for sure.

Hi. You seem to be very close to your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]. Do you know what? I'm a TV reporter. I travel around interviewing people about Pokémon. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to tell me a little about your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?
Wow, thank you! OK, then, please tell me anything you like about your [VAR PKNAME(0000)].
Wow... That's an interesting account. You really are tight with [VAR PKNAME(0000)], aren't you? I get the feeling that your account will make a great BuzzNav story. I promise I'll turn this into an entertaining show! Keep your eye out for it. OK, that's all. Bye-bye!
Oh, OK... Well, if you get the urge to tell me about Pokémon, I'll be here!
I enjoy this job—you get to learn so much about Pokémon by doing interviews.
Wow! It's plain to see that you lavish your love on your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]. OK, it's named [VAR 010C(0001)]. May I ask you a favor? I'm a TV reporter, and I'm running a survey on Pokémon. Would you be willing to answer a simple question for me?
Great! Thank you! OK, here goes. I just need a quick answer, OK?
When you first met [VAR PKNAME(0000)], what did you feel? How would you describe your feelings at the time?
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] is lovingly cared for. If you were to compare it to something you like, what would it be?
This question also relates to your beloved [VAR PKNAME(0000)]. What was it about [VAR PKNAME(0000)] that attracted you?
[~ 10]
I see! Hmm. OK! Thanks for helping me out. Chatting with you was fun and enlightening. Could be our interview will air on BuzzNav. Tune in and check! OK, that's all. Bye-bye!
Oh, OK. Well, if you get the urge to tell me about Pokémon, I'll be here!
I enjoy this job—you get to learn so much about Pokémon by doing interviews.
Oh? Do you perhaps like Pokémon? I'm on assignment with the TV network. I'm gathering current stories on Pokémon and Trainers. If you don't mind, could you tell me something about yourself?
I'm gathering current stories on Pokémon and Trainers. If you don't mind, could you tell me something about yourself?
Oh, you will? Thank you! Then, please, tell me anything of interest that you experienced recently involving Pokémon.
Oh, I see. Well, if you do have an interesting story to tell, please let me know.
What an uplifting story! I'll definitely get your story on BuzzNav, so please look forward to it when it airs!
Hmm. I have a good story for a BuzzNav program. I'd better write it up in a hurry!
Oh! We've just spotted a tough-looking Trainer—here of all places! OK, roll camera! Let's get this interview.
Oh! You're @s! Hi! Do you remember us from last time? Can you show us how much stronger you've become? OK, cue interview!
Is there a strong Trainer anywhere? One with a lot of Pokémon?
[~ 23]
Awesome! Awesome! Who are you?! I knew we were onto something wild when we spotted you! Oh, please let me explain. We travel around everywhere, interviewing all sorts of Trainers. Care to give us a bit of your time for an interview?
“[VAR 01A9(0001)]!” Do you remember? That's the quote you gave us as the battle clincher last time. I never, ever forget stuff like that!
[~ 26]
[~ 27]
[~ 28]
[~ 29]
Anyway, what do you think? Do you want to be interviewed again?
You will? Thank you! OK, I need you to describe your feelings about our battle, but it has to be short and sweet. Go!
Mmm, yeah! That's the perfect clincher! I get the feeling that this will make a great TV show. There's a chance that they'll air this on BuzzNav, so make sure to look for us! Okay! We'll be seeing you!
Oh... OK, but don't give up! We'll be keeping an eye out for you!
We'll be keeping an eye out for you!
Well, could we trouble you for an interview, after all?
[~ 36]
[~ 37]
Hey, lookee here! A tough-looking Trainer here, of all places! Camera's rolling!
Hey, lookee here! I remember you! I'll get this battle down on this here camera!
Do you only have the one Pokémon, and that's it? If you had more Pokémon, it'd make for better footage.
[~ 41]
You're a natural! Got me some prime footage right here! By the way, if it's all right, let Gabby interview you.

Your Pokédex must be jam-packed with all the memories of your journey... I hope you treasure it always!

You've caught a total of [VAR NUM3(0000)] kinds of Pokémon! Fantastic!
And [VAR NUM3(0001)] of those Pokémon belong in the Hoenn Pokédex!

[~ 20]
[~ 21]
[~ 22]
Why, look at this! You've finished the entire Hoenn Pokédex! Fantastic!
I think you'd benefit from a bit more fieldwork out in the tall grass!
It looks like you're getting the hang of things. But the adventure has barely begun!
Remember, when Pokémon appear in only one location, you've got no choice but to keep on searching.
It's still got a lot of room to grow, but it's starting to look like a real Pokédex!
This is really looking good! Keep up this kind of pace!
Have you been using any fishing rods? There are plenty of Pokémon in the sea!
Have you focused on evolving the Pokémon you have, as well as catching new ones?
Why, congratulations! You've seen all of the Pokémon in the Hoenn Pokédex!

Now that things are looking up for Hoenn, if you travel widely, you're sure to meet new Pokémon!
I get the feeling that this is on its way to being a fine Pokédex. Never fear!
To think you'd have caught this many Pokémon... You really do have a talent for this!
It's said that there are many possibilities lurking in the Evolution of Pokémon.
Have you spent any time in the Safari Zone? From what I hear, it's the only place in Hoenn to catch certain Pokémon!
You've finally broken the big 3-0-0! This is a splendid Pokédex!
Oh, that reminds me... I believe there are some Pokémon that you can find using Rock Smash...
Maybe trading Pokémon with others will help you fill up some Pokédex entries.
Did you know that there are some Pokémon that evolve when they feel friendly toward you?
Mega Evolution... Primal Reversion... And who knows what other forms of Evolution that may have become lost in the passage of time... Many evolutionary possibilities may have come and gone since Pokémon first appeared in our world...
Getting to meet the Pokémon who exist in the same brief span of time as you... When you think of it like that, filling in the Pokédex feels like something of a miracle!
One can learn about all the Pokémon in Hoenn by looking through your Pokédex!
The GTS is an effective tool for completing your Pokédex! Give it a try sometime!
I'd recommend trading some Pokémon with your friends.
I must say, you wouldn't make a bad Pokémon Professor yourself.
Look at this Pokédex! You're like a pro now!
Amazing! You're so close to becoming a master of Pokémon catching!
Almost 700... Just a little more! Keep going!
How exciting! You've nearly completed the National Pokédex! I'm absolutely sure you can do it!
Congratulations to you! You've completed the Pokédex! Sniffle... I am overwhelmed. My decision to give you that Pokédex I'd ordered was wholly justified. This completed Pokédex is a testament to your hard work... And to the support of the many who helped you... And to the bonds you have built with your Pokémon! It is a unique treasure!
You've been meeting new Pokémon at a good clip, haven't you? I've got a little something for you, and I'd love it if you stopped by the lab!
You've been meeting new Pokémon at a good clip, haven't you? Here, take this as a little reward for all your hard work!
If you're holding an Oval Charm, you'll have a better chance of finding an Egg at the Pokémon Day Care.
Holding a Shiny Charm will improve your chances of finding a Shiny Pokémon!

See, @s? Isn't it nice in here, too?
The moving company's Pokémon even help with the unpacking and cleanup. They really make moving a cinch!
Well, @s? Don't you want to go see your new room?
@s, go set the clock in your room, honey. I hung it on the wall, right between your desk and that big map.
Oh! @s! @s!!! Quick! Come quickly!
It's the Petalburg Gym! Maybe Dad will be on TV!
Interviewer: ...
Interviewer: We brought you this report live from in front of Petalburg Gym. Next up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower in the next star show...
Oh... It's already ended. Looks like your dad was on, but we missed his part. What a shame.
But that reminds me... One of Dad's friends lives in this town. Professor Birch is his name. He lives right next door, so you should go over and introduce yourself.
Professor Birch lives right next door. Your dad would want you to go say hi. Go stop by while I clean up around here.
Did you get to meet Professor Birch?
You feeling OK, @s? You look a little tired. I think you should rest a bit.
Now take care out there, honey!
Oh? Did Dad give you that Badge?! Then here's something from your mom!
It's a wonderful thing to try hard at your passion, but don't push yourself too hard, dear. You can always come home if you need to. Good luck, honey!
Graoh, graoh, graoh...
Gwagwah gwah...
A movie is on TV. Two men are dancing on a big piano keyboard. Better get going!

Oh, hello. And you are? ... Oh, you're @s, our new next-door neighbor! Welcome! We have a daughter about the same age as you. She has been so excited about making a new friend. She should be in her room upstairs. I hope you'll go and introduce yourself!
Oh, hello. And you are? ... Oh, you're @s, our new next-door neighbor! Welcome! We have a son who is just about the same age as you. He has been so excited about making a new friend. He should be in his room upstairs. I hope you'll go and introduce yourself!
I do hope you'll be friends with my kid. They should be upstairs. Go on up and say hi.
Where is that husband of mine? It was so good of you to visit, @s, and yet he's nowhere to be found!
Where is that husband of mine? It was so good of you to visit, @s, and yet he's nowhere to be found!
Oh? If it's May you're wanting, she's gone off somewhere again. That child is just like her father! Can't stay in the house for five minutes!
Oh? If it's Brendan you're wanting, he's gone off somewhere again. That child is just like his father! Can't stay in the house for five minutes!
It's all well and good to want to adventure with your Pokémon... But kids should at least stop by home from time to time! You should drop by to reassure your mother that you're fine. I'm sure your mother worries about you as well, @s.

The clock on the wall isn't moving... You've got to set the time!
Now the hands are moving right on time!
It's a pretty cool wall clock!
It's a pretty cute wall clock!
How do you like your new room, @s? Good! Everything's put away neatly! They finished moving everything in downstairs, too. It really is so nice having Pokémon around to help us! Oh, but you should make sure that everything's all there on your desk.
[~ 39]
[~ 40]
@s's notebook is full of adventure rules [VAR GENDBR(0000,0100)]she jotted down! ADVENTURE RULE NO. 1 Open the menu with the X Button. ADVENTURE RULE NO. 2 Record your progress with Save.
@s peered closely at the Hoenn region's Town Map!
It's a Wii U! It has a GamePad with a screen!
Pokémon fully restored, items all ready, and...
Huh?! Who...are you?
...
Oh! You must be @s! Your move was today, huh?
Well, I'm May! Glad to meet you!
I...I actually have this dream of becoming friends with Pokémon all over the world.
And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch— told me about you moving here, @s... Well, I was hoping you would be nice and we could be friends.
...B-but that's just silly, isn't it? I've just met you. Right, @s? So what am I talking about...
Hee hee...
Oh no! I forgot! I was supposed to be going out to help Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
@s, I'll see you later!
@s! I was just checking my Pokédex. There's still a lot of Pokémon that I've seen but haven't caught. And there are plenty more that I think can still evolve further. I wonder where I should go next to catch more Pokémon...
I wonder where I should go next to catch more Pokémon... Hopefully somewhere that I might run into you again, @s!
Pokémon fully restored... Items all packed, and...
Y-you... Who are you?
@s? Oh, you're the new kid who just moved in next door?!
Huh... I didn't know that you'd be a girl.
Dad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me you were the kid of a Gym Leader, and I sort of hoped you'd be a guy.
My name's Brendan. Well, I guess we are still neighbors, so... Nice to meet you! Let's be friends, OK?
Huh? Hey, @s... Don't you have any Pokémon? If you want, I can go catch you one.
Aw, wait, I forgot... I'm supposed to be going out to help my dad catch some wild Pokémon.
Some other time, OK?
Oh! Hey, @s! I was just checking out my Pokédex. I know there are even more Pokémon I need to catch, but it's still pretty impressive, right? Checking this Pokédex out gives me the urge to hit the road again on another adventure...
I'm having a hard time deciding where I should go to catch Pokémon next... But, hey, if I run into you while I'm out there catching Pokémon, @s, I can pitch you a battle if you want.
[~ 68]

There are some notes on the page, written in cute, round script. “★ This will be on the next test! ★ Each Pokémon can learn up to four moves! Which moves you teach a Pokémon will show how good of a Trainer you are!”
There are some notes on the page, written in spare, angular script. “This'll be on the test! Don't forget! Each Pokémon can learn up to four moves! Which moves you teach a Pokémon will show how good of a Trainer you are!”
Thanks for all the hard work! We really appreciate it!
You should go and see your new room upstairs, @s! Dad even bought a new clock for it to help celebrate the big move. You'll need to set the time, though!
The hour hand was set to [VAR NUM2(0000)] and the minute hand to [VAR NUM2(0001)]!
Hm?
Why, if it isn't @s! It's been some time since I last saw you, but you look...stronger, somehow. That's the impression I get.
But your old man hasn't given up yet!
Oh, and before I forget... I was thinking of giving these to you.
They're tickets to the star show that's being held at the Mossdeep Space Center. I was really planning to go with your mom, but...
It looks like I've got to rush back to the Gym in Petalburg.
Oh! Hmm. You know, it is a pair of tickets...
Why don't you invite that little cutie May from next door to come along?
Why don't you invite that Brendan boy from next door to come along?
Now I'd better be heading back to the Gym.
Thanks for looking after the house while I'm away, dear.
Of course, dear. You have a safe trip.
Ohhh, that dad of yours! He comes home for the first time in ages, and all he talks about is Pokémon! Why can't he ever just let go and relax?
Television: ...And tomorrow the long- awaited star show will finally begin! We've got all the latest news and updates!
Oh? Well, and just like that... Look at this, @s!
Newscaster: At last the Litleonid meteor shower returns to illuminate Hoenn's night sky! The star show held at the Mossdeep Space Center will provide the best view of the shooting stars from the center's lofty viewing deck! We hope you all will take the chance to join...
Oh! It sounds lovely!
The Litleonids, hmm? I remember going to see them with your dad 11 years ago when they last passed by!
You should march right over to invite that neighbor [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0304)]girlboy you're friends with. You can't let that pair of tickets you got from Dad go to waste—so take h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]erim along!
It's an advertisement for the space show in Mossdeep. ... Better get going!
Ughhh...
Owwww...
May, are you OK?! Oh, what should I do! What should I do?! Oh, wibble...
Brendan, are you OK?! Oh, what should I do! What should I do?! Oh, wibble...
It's not that big of a deal, Mom. She just knocked me down a bit... Yowch! That stings!
It's not that big of a deal, Mom. She just knocked me down a bit... Yowch! That stings!
... Oh! @s!
... Oh! H-hey, @s!
@s, you... You're all right, huh? ...That's a relief.
Looks like she didn't get you, huh? That's a relief.
It all happened so fast that I couldn't do a thing, but... Some strange woman came in my window, upstairs... And then she... She took my Key Stone from me...

I'm really happy you came to visit me, but...I'm sorry... I think I'll have to sit this one out.
Um, it's really cool that you came to visit me, but...sorry... I think I gotta sit this one out...
Who could have done such a thing to my sweet [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0304)]girlboy...
Oh, hello, sweetie. Feel free to stay awhile.
[~ 115]
[~ 116]
[~ 117]
Hm?
Morning, @s.
You must've been bushed. You slept like a log.
Oh, but before I forget... This came for you. It's from someone named Briney.
Hm, so it was a ferry ticket, was it?
As I recall, you can catch the ferry from the ports in Slateport and Lilycove.
@s! If you have ambition as a Trainer, I want you to take that ferry to the Battle Resort. I think it will teach you that there is no end to a Trainer's chosen path.
I'd better be heading back to the Petalburg Gym, then. Thanks for looking after the house while I'm away, honey.
Ohhh, that dad of yours! Can't he ever forget about work? I wish he could just switch it off and take it easy sometimes! But I love him just the way he is...
I suppose May and @s have probably arrived by now...
I suppose Brendan and @s have probably arrived by now...
I imagine so.
The weather is good today. They should get a good view of the stars.
But you know...I really am glad we moved here from Johto.
I think that meeting you, Birch, and Mrs. Birch and little May, has had a huge impact on @s's life.
I think that meeting you, Birch, and Mrs. Birch and your boy, has had a huge impact on @s's life.
Oh, it's just the same for our [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0703)]MayBrendan.
Don't you agree, dear?
Of course!
Whenever she does make it home, all May has to talk about is Pokémon and her precious friend @s.
Whenever he does make it home, all Brendan has to talk about is Pokémon and his pal @s.
I think [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0001)]she's over the moon about this adventure and the great friend [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0001)]she's found.
I think our [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl is just the same. They always looks so happy these days.
I hope you'll continue to look after our @s for many more years to come.
Bwahahaha! Why, Norman! You don't even have to ask... Nothing could make me happier!
Hahahaha... Thanks, old friend.
...Well then, dear, isn't it about time we were headed back home? I should get supper started...
Oh, yes! Those kids'll probably be starving when they get home!
Oh, I didn't make any plans yet for dinner... What do you think we should have, dear?
Hmm. How about our little [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl's favorite?
...Oh!
That reminds me! Here! I've been thinking I should give you this, @s...
Remember the night you went to see the star show? Well, I found this in the grass out front the next morning! Isn't it pretty, the way it sparkles? It's like a rainbow!
Looks like Mom jotted something down! There are notes about tonight's dinner plans!
There are plans for a whole week's worth of meals!

Young one... Use this and awaken your Pokémon's hidden powers...
When a Pokémon learns the move Hidden Power, somehow I can tell what type that move will be... Want to know what type of Hidden Power your Pokémon will learn?

Sigh... I have today off from work, but it's like... Just thinking about going back tomorrow is dragging me down. I feel so unmotivated.
Hey, do you have a minute for a story? This is something that happened when I was watching the store one time...
It was, like, a totally dark night. Moonless. And I was all, “No way! This is so-o-o-o creepy!” Then, suddenly—whoosh! Out of nowhere, the automatic sliding door...slides open. And then this super-duper-scary old guy comes in, kinda unsteady, you know? Kinda shambling...
So I'm thinking how terrible and scary is this, and then the old guy shuffles over to me... He has a package, like, clutched in his hands... He's mumbling that he has to show it to me... Then he asks, “Do you know what this is worth?” He keeps staring right at me and not even blinking. I was so freaked out. I was, like... “Oh yes. It's, uh, really something, isn't it?”
So the old guy grins at me, and he says... “Then I'll just give you this instead of money. Now give me everything you've got in this store!” That's what he said! Really! I was like, “What is this? Too weird, my dude!” But I was scared, so I started shoveling over Potions and, like, whatever I could reach. I gave the dude everything for his stupid package. And out he goes, like, with a wicked grin on his face...
As he's walking out, he says, “Three days... For a mere three days will Hoopa be unbound...” Really! I was all, “Stop freaking me out with this nonsense!” I was, like, sweating. The back of my shirt was soaked. Anyway, nothing I could do, so I open the package. It's just a dirty old bottle. Li-i-i-i-ike, really. So I go, “Weirdness. Wonder what's in it.” I grab the stopper and carefully pull it loose. Blapt! It popped open, but there was nothing inside! So I figure I totally got fooled.
...Thanks for listening to my story. Know what? I'm gonna give you the bottle from that night 'cause you're so nice. It's not doing me any good anyway. Really.
Sometimes I wonder if it really is only a dirty old bottle. Those last words that the old guy said as he left... “For a mere three days will Hoopa be unbound...” Just can't seem to get that out of my head...
Oh... You're that kid from that time...
What did you end up doing with that old bottle? Though...I guess it doesn't matter anymore. Really. It's just, even now, it's still bugging me, you know? “For a mere three days will Hoopa be unbound...” That's what he said. I just can't seem to forget it...

Hot diggidy! That's a Volcanion you have there, isn't it?
As far as I know, the people in that group are the only ones in history to have seen this Pokémon. To think that I'd meet a Trainer who not only found Volcanion, but actually caught it!
What a day! I like you, kid! I'm the head of this TV studio. How about I show you some top-secret specials we made about Volcanion?
They're a little something I made for a TV show once back in the day, but... Well, things didn't work out, and they ended up getting shelved.
OK! Sit back and enjoy! My top-secret Volcanion specials!
All right! Which clip would you like to watch?
This is a special edition of MVTV: Explorations of the Ancient World! Join us deep in the swamplands of the Kalos region where we found a mythical Volcanion! ... Explorer: “B-boss! There it is! It's Volcanion!” Brandon: “Oh! Get back! If it blows, it could send even huge mountains flying! It can change moisture into super-heated steam in an instant with its internal organs causing a massive explosion!” Explorer: “That was a close one! Thanks for saving me, boss!” Brandon: “Stay alert at all times! Don't forget your courage sensor!”
This is a special edition of MVTV: Explorations of the Ancient World! Join us in the untouched woodlands of the Sinnoh region where we found a mythical Volcanion! ... Explorer: “B-boss! There it is!

If we stay here, we'll be trapped in the fog!” Explorer: “That was a close one! Thanks for saving me, boss!” Brandon: “Stay alert at all times! Don't forget your courage sensor!”
This is a special edition of MVTV: Explorations of the Ancient World! Join us on a desert island in the Johto region where we found a mythical Volcanion! ... Explorer: “B-boss! There it is!

Please, just a moment, mon chou! I need you to attendez!
Do forgive us, young m[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0705)]asteristress, for speaking without an introduction. There is a matter of great import that we must discuss. Is it true that you have somehow obtained the Mythical Pokémon Diancie?
Diancie... The inexplicable mutation arising from the Pokémon we know as Carbink... When and where it originates from, and the mécanisme of its formation... It is indeed a mystérieuse existence, one of des plus grands mystères!
Diancie is the epitome of beauty among Pokémon. The divine symmetry of its body enables it to absorb light and display a radiance beyond the awareness of this realm. It is said that, upon Mega Evolving, Mega Diancie emanates a beauty that surpasses all known beauty.
That beauty... It is so dazzling to behold that people call it the “Royal Pink Princess.” Our jeune maître—young master—has been searching for Diancie in order to see this beauty fantastique. And we two have managed to obtain the Diancite that is nécessaire for its Mega Evolution. We have been most ardent to discover a Diancie that we might take back to our young master, to show to him this famed beauté ultime. Yet we have proved unsuitable to the task, unable to secure the indispensable Diancie!
Please allow me to ask you directly... Will you agree to relinquish your Diancie to us?
No way!
All right...
Is there no way we can persuade you?
Mon chou, please... If you could only...
Vraiment? You will? Oh, what a relief to have met with a Trainer so understanding! Then...
...Wait.
M-master?!
Hey, I'm sorry they've been bugging you.
Um, you guys... I'm really glad you tried so hard to find a Diancie for me. Truly. But... Well, I think you might be on the wrong track.
I'm not even that into finding a Diancie anymore, you know. What I really want now is a big, tough Pokémon—you know?
So, you've got a Diancie, right? How about we give you the Diancite we found? It'd be a crazy waste to have a rare Pokémon like that and never even Mega Evolve it. You know?
That's what you gotta do, am I right? Mega Evolve them like bam! And then... Pow! Pow! And end that battle in a flash! Even if folks do call it a royal pink whatever, I bet a Mega Evolved Diancie would be crazy strong! Who knows? You keep rolling your way through battles and strolling away with victories! That's what I wanna see, you know!
OK, you two! Now let's shoot for a big, tough Pokémon!
Ohoho... Mon jeune maître...

Ahoy! We've struck land in Dewford, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss. I suppose you'll be heading ashore to deliver that letter to what's-his-name or whomever. If you're ever feeling lost and adrift though, try calling in on the island's Pokémon Gym. The Leader, Brawly, surely knows everyone and everything that goes on in his town!
Have you delivered that letter yet? Or were you meaning to sail back Petalburg way, maybe?
To Petalburg and environs! Anchors aweigh! Peeko, we're setting sail, my darling!
Then you go on and deliver that letter. I have the deck. If you're ever feeling lost and adrift though, try calling in on the island's Pokémon Gym. The Leader, Brawly, surely knows about everything that goes on here in his town!
Ahoy! We've hit land in Dewford! You just go on and tell me whenever you want to set sail again, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss!
Ahoy! We'll lift anchor anytime for you! So tell me, my friend, where are we bound?
Petalburg City, or thereabouts? Anchors aweigh! Peeko, we're setting sail, my darling!
Slateport City, is it? Anchors aweigh! Peeko, we're setting sail, my darling!
Just tell me whenever you want to hoist anchor again.
Route 104 (near Petalburg)
Head to Dewford
Route 109 (near Slateport)
Never mind
Ahoy! We've made land in Slateport! I suppose you're off to visit Captain Stern and deliver those Devon Parts?
Aren't you about delivering those Devon Parts? Or were you meaning to sail back to Dewford?
Dewford it is, then! Anchors aweigh! Peeko, we're setting sail, my darling!
Then you go on and deliver those Devon Parts. I'll wait till all's blue.
Ahoy! We've hit land in Slateport! You go on and tell me if-an'-ever you want to set sail again, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss!
[~ 18]
You just tell me if-an'-ever you need to set sail again!
Hold on, lass! Belay that, Peeko!
Oh, if it ain't @s! You're the one who saved my Peeko! Aye, but we owe you for that day! What's that? You want to sail with me? What's this all about, then? A letter bound for Dewford? Certainly, that'd be no problem at all. You've come to the right man! Shall we hoist sail for Dewford at once?
Oh, if it ain't @s! You're the one who saved my Peeko! Aye, but we owe you for that day! What's that? You want to sail with me? What's this all about then? A letter bound for Dewford? Certainly, that'd be no problem at all. You've come to the right man! Shall we hoist sail for Dewford at once?
Dewford, we're a-coming! Anchors aweigh! Peeko, we're setting sail, my darling!
Your delivery can wait? You're one to gaff off! You just go on and tell me whenever you want to set sail.
Ahoy! I know exactly what you want to say! You're to deliver that letter to Dewford, or ain't that so? You've come to the right man if that's the case! Shall we hoist anchor for Dewford first?
Ahoy! I know exactly what you want to say! You've still got to deliver that case to young Stern in Slateport. Ain't that so? You just leave it up to this old seadog! Weigh anchors! We're for Slateport today!
Ahoy! We'll lift anchor anytime for you! So tell me, my friend, where are we bound?
You sure about that? Well, Peeko owes her life to you, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss. You just go on and tell me anytime you want to set sail. I'll brave any tide for you!
[~ 29]
Oho! It looks as though you have delivered your chit good and proper. Ah, but that reminds me! I've had a message from President Stone, saying he has another favor to ask. It's about them Devon Parts that you recovered for him before. Seems as though they should go to some fellow called Stern at Slateport's shipyard. This old seadog will see you there safely! Weigh anchors! We're for Slateport!

... Looks like I won't be needing THIS... Hiyyup!
Phew! That's sooo much better! Ooooh, I feel so free! That uniform got pretty stinky after a while! And all sweaty, too!
Murrrm!
Ohhh, my adorable little Aster!  Are you that happy to see me looking like myself again, hmm?  Ahhh, you're just too darned cute! Like always!
Phew.
But there's not much time left for us. It'll only be a matter of weeks... ...No. Days.
Things have gotten a bit tricky now, since that kid managed to stop one of the super-ancient Pokémon from being revived like it should've been.
Not that it's a really big deal. I've already thought of a new plan. If I just tweak a bit with a Key Stone, one with plenty of THAT built up...
Whisss...
I swear I'll protect you. ...Aster.
...
See that, Aster? You always wanted to watch them, right? The Litleonids. A million glittering stars falling from the sky... The show is about to start.
Mur! Murrr!
Aren't we happy now? Yes, what could be better, dear Aster? Ha ha...
... Welcome to the Dragonhark altar. @s. You know what I am trying to do here by now, don't you?
Ever since I was a little girl, I have always turned my eyes up to the sky. When I was so full of uncertainty that I felt my heart might be crushed by it... When I was so grief-stricken and alone I thought my heart might break of it...
What about you? Have you ever had to do something like that?
I have.
Never.
Right...
Ahaha! You're just too honest! Don't you know that you're supposed to agree, and then we'd share a touching moment of pain?
... I used to watch the stars like this all the time... Together with Aster. We were always together. In good times and in bad.
But I still lost her.
... Hahaha... ... I want to see her... I want to be with her again... My sweet Aster...
Mum...?
I will, won't I? With this... Just a little longer...
Mur, mur!
Guess I should say good morning?
You slept well, didn't you? You look so adorable when you sleep. Sorry about the knocking-you-out thing.
... Enough. I think it's time I gave it a shot.
I'm sorry...for all the trouble I caused you. If something happens to me... Please... Take this little one...
... ... ...OK. Here I go.
“With jewel bright and borrowed might from the spirits of the departed...”
“Through sacred rite, in thy great sight, my life as well I offer...”
The Key Stones that Zinnia holds are giving off a blinding light!
...Ugh...ngh...gh...
“I summon thee...to aid...this fight... and save us...from disaster!”
Kiryararararahhh!!!
!!!
Kiryarassshhhaaahhh!
Ray...quaza!
I did it! I...I did it!
Now the world...will be saved! Aster... Aster, I did it!
Great Rayquaza! Hear my wish! Achieve your Mega Evolution! Take hold of your true power! Show me your true face! The Rayquaza that will save this planet!
... ... ... Zinnia's Key Stone does not react...
Huh?!
H-how can this be?!
I gathered all of the Key Stones that could withstand your great power... and summoned you here... You came...
And yet... Why?!
Come on! Do it! Mega Evolve! Why?! Why won't you...
... ... Zinnia's Key Stone does not react...
Kirrrurrrurrr...
What?!
It can't be... The one without enough power...is you, Rayquaza?
The Meteorites that should lie within Rayquaza's great body...aren't enough? Have these thousand years drained them of their power?
This...can't...be...
I can't...
I... I... Everything...I've done...till now...
Aster... I can't... I can't take any...more...
...
@s's Meteorite suddenly began to glow!
That's—?!
The glow of @s's Meteorite grew even stronger!
What? That Meteorite?!
It's just like...a Mega Stone?!
Kiryarararaaahhh!!!
Rayquaza swallowed @s's Meteorite!
Kirrrihrrrihrrrihhhh!!!
Light is spilling forth from within Rayquaza's body!
Whoa!!!
Swallowing meteorites allows it to store as much power as a Mega Stone. Your Meteorite summoned forth the power needed for Rayquaza to Mega Evolve!
Kirrrihrrrihrrriii!!!
Hah! It's amazing!
@s! Rayquaza is trying to build up power... It wants power for itself to take you on! Use everything you've got and win over Rayquaza! You have to master it!
If you need a Poké Ball, I've got one!
Kiiiryarrrarrrarrrraaaashiiiii!!!
Is it...over?
Murrrrrr!
... Congratulations, @s. And...thank you.
History has chosen you... The truth remains that Rayquaza chose you and not me... But... While I don't know how to put it into words exactly... I think I understand why...
...You will be successor to our long history now. And I pass to you the final key to Rayquaza's true power. The move that only it can learn: Dragon Ascent...
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] succeeded to the power of Dragon Ascent!
...That's it, then.
I guess...it's time that I do my last task as Lorekeeper.
You have obtained Rayquaza's power for your own... Now I will have you prove to me that you can master that power... in battle! That is my final... The final duty of the last Lorekeeper of the Draconid people!
Show me that you can exceed it—the entirety of history that we have clung to until today!
...Phew.
...
My pulse... I can feel it racing...
...Yes. I'm feeling...totally...pumped!
Haaahhh!
This is it!!
[~ 92]
...
...
...I guess...it falls to you now...
That settles it, then...
@s, you should even be able to beat that meteoroid that's approaching the planet. You and Rayquaza...together.
I am leaving this task to you, our new Successor. Successor @s. You and Rayquaza must protect nature...Pokémon...the people...
Mur!
You received a letter from Aster!
Mur murrr!
“I was finally able to bring everything to an end.” “I thank you for that.” “I think I'll spend some time now trying to find out if it's also possible to forge a new beginning for something once lost.” “Until we meet again,                         Zinnia”

Realize them...upon this world...! For this do I summon thee!
Rayquazaaa!!!
This is the Legendary Pokémon that all Hoenn views as our great protector! And the only one who can direct it now...
It's you! You have to do this!
I turned and looked up there... so that my tears would never, ever fall.
I loved her. I loved her with everything I had...
That's right. I will summon Rayquaza to this world to destroy the meteoroid headed for Hoenn.
That is my... It is our duty.

So you came for me. Thanks for that.
That's really good, @s. I really feel it, right here.
That's really good, @s. I really feel it, right here.
Mm-hmm...
Since you've been a good boy, I think I'll give you something I've been keeping.
Since you've been a good girl, I think I'll give you something I've been keeping.
Look... The paintings that cover the walls of this tower... See, these are the history of humanity, of Pokémon, and of nature itself. They're the tales that have been passed down by my ancestors, the Draconids, for thousands of years. And now...I will pass that history and lore on to you.
Thousands of years ago, in the primal age long lost, the world was overflowing with natural energy. Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre fought over that energy in endless, furious clashes.
In the face of Primal Groudon and Kyogre's great power, people could do nothing. The only choice was to watch as disaster upon disaster swept over them.
It was in such a time that a great many meteoroids poured from the darkness of space, from a place higher even than the heavens. And the meteoroids fell in their multitude upon a waterfall that had long been home to a tribe of Dragon-type-Pokémon users...
...OK! That's it! That's the end of the first chapter of my tale.
I'll tell you the next part of the story on the next floor. Look forward to it!
Oh! Here you are!
Let me continue. It's finally time for chapter two. Here we go!
At last, right? Hah! I know you're thrilled.
The meteors shone with a rainbow brilliance, as if some great life was held within.
That was when, as if drawn by the brilliance, a Pokémon that shone in a blazing emerald hue descended from the heavens... That Pokémon was none other than Rayquaza.
Rayquaza's power overwhelmed that of the two Primal Pokémon, and peace returned to the world. The people of Hoenn revered Rayquaza as a true savior.
A thousand years after this time, the meteoroids once again fell. A huge meteoroid, far greater than any before, struck the planet, boring deep into the ocean and leaving behind it a crater larger than any other. The land born of this event later become known as Sootopolis.
And that is it! Chapter two is over!
But we've only just left the starting line. There's a long way yet—don't fall behind now!
Now, our tale reaches the best part. Sootopolis was born from a great meteoroid strike.
The great meteoroid was the first of many disasters to befall humanity. When it punched into the planet, the land cracked beneath it, and a great welling of natural energy poured from beneath Hoenn. Thirsting for that energy, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon once again woke.
The people had a wish—a memory from a thousand years before... They wished that the Legendary Pokémon clad in emerald light would appear again. The huge Meteorite that lay at the heart of Sootopolis gave off a boundless brilliance. In its brilliance, it resembled a vast and powerful Key Stone. And once again, Rayquaza descended from whence it came in the heavens.
The people fell to their knees before Rayquaza and made a wish for salvation. As they did, a great change came over the Legendary Pokémon. It was enveloped in blinding light. As the light receded, they beheld a Rayquaza beyond all knowledge— a sublime figure, incandescent with overwhelming life force.
It was humanity's wish that brought about Rayquaza's transformation in the face of the rainbow stone... Yes... A wish... An intangible thing, invisible to the eye. Yet this wish bound people and Pokémon together, enabling the Legendary Pokémon to change its appearance... Doesn't it remind you of something? That's right... It sounds like Mega Evolution, doesn't it?
And how did the story end? After being transformed by the wish of the people, did Rayquaza save them from disaster?
Rayquaza once again confronted Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. The golden filaments that sprang from its body covered the sky. An emerald brilliance illuminated the area. A terrible wind rose.
The wind and emerald light visibly sapped the power from Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Drained of their primal powers, the two vanished into the depths of land and sea. Rayquaza watched them go, regaining its usual appearance. Then it soared back up into the heavens where it dwelled. A witness to this series of events, a tall visitor from a distant land, said, “It is the Δ (Delta), born of the great disturbances in this world.” “By the bonds born of mankind's wish and the power of the stones, it will calm the troubles that plague the world.”
That was when the Draconids constructed their great tower, to hold the rainbow stone that had granted Rayquaza its power, and to try to get a little bit closer to Rayquaza in the heavens above. To record the history of their trials and the great feats of mighty Rayquaza for all to know, they left behind the murals you see here.
A giant tower... And paintings of the past... You know, I feel like I've seen something like that recently. Heh. But now, I suppose it's time for the last chapter in our tale.
At last we reach the final chapter...
A thousand years of peace followed after that disastrous time. But the Draconid people, learning from their long history's cyclical nature, foretold that the meteoroids would fall on this land again. The meteoroid to come, they prophesized, would be far greater than those that had come before it. This meteoroid would be great enough to break the world forever...
In order to prevent this great calamity, those who held the knowledge of the past arrived at a plan. Their plan was to invoke Rayquaza, the great savior, and summon it to this land before the meteoroid could strike.
And that's it. That's the end of our... of the Draconids' tale.
I spent a long time thinking about how I could protect the happiness of as many people as possible. What I must do, as one who holds both the knowledge and the power... One who bears the heavy wishes of those who could not...live up to that fate... Well, I had to be really creative, you know?

It's a model of a large sailing vessel! There is not a single mote of dust on top of the model.
It's a showcase! There is a lock on it, so you can't open it.
It's the Team Magma flag!
...
...
...
...
...
...
Uwaahhh!
This conversation isn't proceeding as expected!
Ugh...
If it has come to this, then I, Tabitha, shall handle this myself!
Courtney!
Y-yes?!
Apologize to Leader Maxie!
Hu-huh?! Ow...ch...
Hurry up! OK?! Just say, “Sorry!”
I'm sorry! Leader Maxie, I'm sorry! I won't do it...anymore! I'll never do anything...like that...again!
So please... Forgive... Forgive me.
?!
Wah...wah... Sniffle...
What are you—?!
Sniff...sniffle... Ohh...ooh...
... ... Fine.
I understand.
Courtney. I, the great Maxie, will forgive you.
But only on one condition!
Huh?!
?
You must...also forgive me.
Courtney. I never imagined... I never could have imagined...
How very loyal you were to me. Nor did I imagine even one iota of the shock you must have experienced, due to my recent speech and conduct, or how it could have pained you. The one who drove you to such an extreme act was me. I am truly sorry for that.
You see, Courtney, I would like to start on a new path. There are truths that I have learned because of the mistakes I have made. They pit me against others who are not like me and against ideas that differ from mine. They tell me the importance of understanding these others, even though we may continue to cause pain to one another. And that holds true whether the opponent I face is human, Pokémon, or even the might of nature itself. I will take this step forward, free from hesitation, and meet my foe. And together we will find a way to create, not destroy. Or so I hope. That is the vision that I, Maxie, have for Team Magma's future.
Will you come with me on this journey as well? Courtney.
Wahh... Uwahh... Waahhh! Waahhh... Of course I will!
My... You certainly do cry a lot.
Ahyahya! And that settles that! Ahyahyahyahya!
Guh—?!
All right! And the winner is Zinnia!
Leader Maxie! Please compose yourself!
Grr...
The great Maxie has fallen to this woman?!
Murrr!♪ Murrr!♪
Oh, oh, what's this? Aren't you a happy girl, Aster? ♪
Just what I'd expect of my daughter! We're so in sync! Ahahaha!
Woman... Who are you?
Who am I? That's a surprisingly difficult question.
... I couldn't become who I was supposed to be, so who does that make me now? ...
Haha! Whatever, right? Enough with the introspection and the soul searching...
You there! @s! Don't just stand there like a stick in the mud. Come on over and say hi.
Could it be?! The child?!
You... Why are you here?
Isn't it obvious? He's the hero, right? Here to save the world again.
Isn't it obvious? She's the heroine, right? Here to save the world again.
Oops. But looks like [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's a bit too late this time. If only you'd been here just one minute earlier!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone away from Maxie!
You—?!
Le-leader?!
All right. I'd say this Key Stone is mine.
We finally got everything, Aster.
Murrr?
Now we can do it: The summoning.
We will summon Rayquaza!
Well then, looks like my job here is done. So don't mind me while I excuse myself.
Oh. @s?
I really hope you'll come chasing after me, you know? We'll be heading to that ancient tower, sealed since primal times, the Sky Pillar.
If you don't know what that is, well, ask that former Champ of yours. He'll know what I'm talking about.
See you there!
Murrr!
Wh-wh-wh-wh— What is going on here?! Who does she think she is, messing up our base and then giving us the slip?! That can never be forgiven!
...
Now I see...
Yes, it was not chance that brought you here now. This was inevitable.
Leader?
Tabitha. Give it to him.
Tabitha. Give it to her.
What did you say?! I-is that all right?!
Yes... Now that the Key Stone has been stolen, a Mega Stone will serve me no purpose.
Acknowledged.
Cameruptite. Make sure your Camerupt holds on to it tightly.
I do not have the power now to use Mega Evolution. So I entrust it to you. I entrust it believing that this is the best action I can now take!
That woman... She had such utter mastery over her Dragon-type Pokémon. There is more to her than meets the eye.
I do not know what must be going through her mind. But...I think you may be the only one who can now stand against her. So I ask you this favor: Rage! Take up this fight for me, and bring this crisis to its resolution!
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app rang on your PokéNav Plus!
Steven: @s! Are you all right?!
Steven: @s! Are you all right?!
Steven: ... Steven: Is that right... I never even imagined... Steven: The Key Stone... The Sky Pillar... And the Draconid people... Steven: So that's it... I begin to see the line connecting these dots. Steven: I think we need to meet up at once to discuss what we should do next. Steven: I'll be waiting at the Space Center. Up on 2F. Steven: Do hurry.
...Kzt!
That woman... She said that the former Champion would know what she was about. I assume you of all people should know where to find him, but...?
Please, do get her for our dear Leader, Maxie!
Child. Ah... Forgive me. I should greet you properly by now, @s.
Child. Ah... Forgive me. I should greet you properly by now, @s.
Feel free to spend one hour, or even a day, in our hideout. We will always welcome a visit from you, @s.
Feel free to spend one hour, or even a day, in our hideout. We will always welcome a visit from you, @s.
Ahyahya! Listen up, child! Chief Admin will be the title that I, Tabitha, am referred to by in our newly reborn Team Magma! I've successfully made my way past being just any old Admin! Ahyahya! Capable people are quick to succeed! Ahya! Ahyahyahyahya!
Welcome. Glad to see you looking well.

It's a machine for irradiating a Meteorite with lasers. It seems experiments were being conducted until just this moment. The surroundings of the machine smell like something burned.
PROJECT AZOTH File No. 2 We intend to analyze the power of the ultimate weapon used in Kalos 3,000 years ago and work on the development of a drill weapon utilizing the technology. The Seafloor Cavern is sealed by the power of a Legendary Pokémon. The only way to gain access to the cavern is to break the seal with power that exceeds that of the Pokémon. According to the report from the Petalburg recon team, Devon Corporation holds the secret of the technology of the ultimate weapon. We will dedicate all our resources to obtaining this technology.
It's a machine for testing the durability of the suit. Touch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say, “Give it a walloping” “Throw a lot of weight on it” “Wring it tightly” “Drop it from really high up” “Burn it severely” “Submerge it intensely” “Thrash it hard” “Knead it massively”
“Danger! Please don't play inside.” “Caution! It's super dangerous! Really! I mean it!” “If something bad happens because you didn't believe me, don't blame me!” ...That's what's written on a note tacked to the wall.
Sturdy protective gear is attached to the machine.
Beep, beep, beep. I AM AN A.I. MY PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAGMA SUIT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAGMA SUIT IS 120 PERCENT COMPLETE. CONGRATULATIONS. THE MAGMA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND WATER PRESSURE AT ANY DEPTH. THE MAGMA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND THE G-FORCES OF THE SECOND COSMIC VELOCITY. IT IS AN ULTRA SUPER SUIT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, THE INSIDE OF THE SUIT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS SLIGHTLY HUMID AND WET. ...sorry about that... THIS CONCLUDES MY STATUS REPORT. GOOD-BYE. Beep, beep, beep.
It's a machine that controls lasers to irradiate Meteorites. Touch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say, “Fire the laser beam delicately.” “Fire the laser beam a little bit more.” “Fire the laser beam fairly judiciously.” “Fire the laser beam like whoa.”
The Magma Suit is the fruit of the collaboration of Devon's and our science and technology. If not for Tabitha, aka Tabitabi, who used to work for Devon, the invention would never have materialized.
I keep suppressing the urge to drink soda, and then I praise myself for it. Yes! I'm a man who knows how to create a small successful experience for myself.
Meteorites... Natural energy... Super-ancient Pokémon... Here, we're conducting experiments to understand how they all relate and create a Red Orb artificially. But...we haven't had much success. It may be too difficult for humans to solve.

PROJECT AZOTH File No. 1 The goal of Project AZOTH is to return the world— return everything—to the beginning. In order to further the project, we must proceed with research on Groudon's Primal Reversion. Primal Reversion is a potential of Pokémon Evolution, a potential different from Mega Evolution. Mega Evolution is made possible by the energy of people and Pokémon. Primal Reversion is made possible by natural energy. In Primal Reversion, Groudon absorbs natural energy into its body, thereby increasing its power dramatically. Both states significantly enhance Pokémon's power: the difference lies in the source of the required energy.
A huge monitor is hung on the wall.
I heard our leader Maxie and Team Aqua's leader Archie used to be on the same team.
Sniff, sniff... Today's smell check of our beds is done! They're fine. They smell good.
HOT! The magma flowing in this tube is super hot! I know better than to touch things that I know are hot.
Hey, you—no, no, no. This is Team Magma's library, where documents on our highly confidential plan are stored. No outsiders are allowed to enter.
The Project AZOTH... A stands for the beginning, Z stands for the end—that's what I think, but I don't know what O, T, and H stand for.
All of us gather and listen to our leader Maxie's edifying speech at 11 o'clock every morning. Every morning. EVERY morning...
There's a bed. Let's take a rest.

What? What? What do you want with Team Magma? Our boss isn't here! He's gone off to steal something important! ... Where did he go? Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with Team Magma? Our boss isn't here! He's gone off to steal a submarine! ... Where did he go? Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
We, Team Magma, decided to make a fresh start with Maxie!
That Trainer with the black bobbed hair... She was incredibly strong. But our leader is beyond the rooms full of warp panels. It's not that easy to get there...
Finally, Team Magma was able to make a fresh start!
Mumble, mumble... Staying on my feet all day makes my feet swell. I hate it.
Mumble, mumble... I stopped whining about standing all day, and it doesn't bother me anymore.
We're insanely busy preparing for the new Team Magma.
A woman with a Whismur is...inside...
What shall I do from now on? There's no rush, so I'll take my time to figure it out.
What? What? What do you want with Team Magma? Our boss isn't here! He's on his way to Mt. Pyre on Route 122! ... Why did he go? Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with Team Magma? Our boss isn't here! He's on his way to Slateport City! ... Why did he go? Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with Team Magma? Well, we don't mind you coming here for no reason, though.
What...what...what is that Dragon-type-Pokémon user... Her strength... It's really something. By any chance, is she stronger than Maxie...?
Honestly, making a fresh start is too much of a bother and hard. But if all of us work together, we might be able to make it. Team Magma is the team that makes me feel that way.
Black bob hair... Actually, she's my type.
One bad thing happens after another— but we have to get through this.
Maxie seems to be fine for now. What a relief!

D-d-don't scare me like that! You scared the living daylights out of me! Hah... Anyway... By any chance did you come here to look for the rare Pokémon, too?
Oh, you don't know the rumor? OK. I'll tell you, then. According to my grandfather, this cave long has been rumored to be the place where a rare Fire-type Pokémon lives. The Pokémon has a magma-like body and sharp claws... But it's too dark to move forward from here without Flash. It's a bit scary. You know, in a pitch-black place like this, if something falls from the ceiling, you can't tell what it is... Eww. I'm thinking about going back to Lavaridge and coming back better prepared. So I'm leaving now, but if you go farther, please be careful!
You, too... Oh, I see. As you may have heard, this cave has long been rumored to be the place where a rare Fire-type Pokémon lives. That's why I came here. But I guess I was a bit ill prepared...

Oh! A Hi Skitty doll... Isn't it cute? I remember when these were all the rage... But I wonder why it's here... Wasn't this an office?

No thanks
“Dear Daddy, How are you? Are you working really hard? I'm doing well. I'm doing all my homework, and I'm helping at home, too. Mommy's working hard and makes us dinner every night. Do you have to work this weekend? Are you going to come home? If you come home, take me to see the star show, OK?                              —Takao Cozmo P.S. I'm going to send you the picture I drew at the Trainers' School.”
It looked like another letter, but it's a drawing. The drawing is of a boy's face, and written next to it are the words “I love you, Daddy.”
“Dear Daddy, How are you? Are you working really hard? I was sad that you didn't come last weekend. But Mommy didn't seem so sad. She went out with her friend. I finally got that telescope that I've been wanting. It was from you, wasn't it? Thanks, Daddy. I really, really wanted it. I like looking at the sky, Daddy. When I look at the stars, I wonder if you are looking at the same stars, too. Let's look at the stars together, next time you come home.                              —Takao Cozmo”
“Dear Daddy, How are you? You aren't working too hard, are you? You never come home anymore. I'm worried if you're OK. Mommy goes out with her friends a lot. It seems like fun, so I guess she's doing OK. The Shelgon that you gave me evolved the other day. But I liked it better when it was a Shelgon and it looked like a Meteorite. Salamence was kind of a letdown, so I asked a friend to trade it for his Solrock. I'm sorry, Daddy. I know it was a present, but I think Solrock is cooler. When it gets dark tonight, I'm going to look at the stars again. I'll think of you when I do.                              —Takao Cozmo”
“Dear Daddy, I was really, really happy to get to meet you the other day. It was so fun playing together again, and going to see the star show, too, even if it was just the two of us. It was sad that Mommy couldn't go, and even more sad when you and Mommy fought that night. I'll study hard, just like you told me, and I'll be a good boy, so don't fight. But let me keep watching the stars, even if I have to do all my homework, too. When I grow up, I want to be a professor and study the stars.                              —Takao Cozmo”
“Dear Daddy, Thank you for writing to me. I'm doing really well here, so please don't worry about me. I hope I'll see you again someday. I dream about it all the time. I brought the telescope you bought me to our new house. Please don't work too hard, Daddy. I hope you are OK. I will always, always love the stars, and I will always, always love you.                              —Takao Cozmo P.S. I'll give you my Hi Skitty doll. Please take care of it for me.”
It looked like another letter, but it's a photo. There's a little boy holding a telescope, with a woman beside him, looking bored.
Want to read another letter?
It's a tattered clipping from an old magazine cover. On the cover is a young lady who looks like Lisia. “Termination of New Mauville Project Officially Announced at Last! Serious Talks Begin about the Closure of Sea Mauville! Cries of Concern Erupt from Staff Members Working at Sea Mauville! Greater Mauville Holdings Reps Remain Tight-Lipped about the Issues! Project Leader Wattson Weighs In on Problems Plaguing New Mauville!” The rest of the magazine has been torn away...
...
It's a card that has mold growing on it. “Sea Mauville Employee ID Group Leader Stern Excavation Unit No. 8 (Team I)”
It's an old, hide-bound notebook. “The damage caused by the cancellation of the New Mauville project has been catastrophic. As a member of the management, much of the blame and the debts will fall upon me. But that will be little consolation to the employees working under me who will lose their livelihoods. I couldn't do a thing for them... I'm a man with no power... Protecting nature and Pokémon and the environment... It's great as an idea. It's a fine ideal to aspire to. And Wattson is a great man for dreaming of it all. But cruel reality and the organization that I must try to preserve have dashed those dreams. I couldn't do a thing for him... I'm a man with no power...” This is the last page with writing on it. Other pages have been torn out.
There are dirty papers inside the cabinet... “Sea Mau—nal Newsletter #389 We ha— a new winne—he monthly slogan—mpetition! It's—alty—the lea—Storage Unit No. 1— ith— Don't dirty the seas with pollution and dumping! Dirty your uniform with sweat and hard work!

It's a mattress with springs poking out of it. There's something underneath it... It's an old-looking magazine of some kind. “Captivating Landscapes from around the World!”
It's an odd-smelling mattress. There's something underneath it... It's a torn magazine of some kind. “Rugged Vehicles from around the World!”
It's a bed with ragged sheets. There's something underneath it... It's a torn magazine of some kind. “What You Need to Know about Unemployment”
It's a bed that seems to have been chewed on. There's something underneath it... It's a colorful magazine of some kind. “The Fame and the Shame! Champions Exposed!”
The locker's handle has broken off. It's so rusted that it doesn't even budge...
It feels as though you're being watched...
There are little glass bottles lined up inside a dusty cabinet, all with the same label... “Wake Up with Devon Energy Elixir! Now with Refined Seviper Extract! Increase your Focus! Work for Days! You'll Never Need Another Rest!”
Shahhh!

Places like this are rare, so I'm taking a good look around. Hmm-hmm-hmm... There appear to be other rooms...
It's a filing cabinet whose glass has been broken. Huh? There's a key hanging at the back.
It's a file cabinet with broken glass. There's nothing important.
It's a cabinet covered with dust. Grass is growing from an opened drawer.
Wha— How in the world did you get in? I locked the door... All right. You want this, don't you? Take this!
I was teaching this girl how hard it is to be a Trainer!
...Blush...
There's an old note at the back of the cabinet with broken glass. “Finally, the date of closing has been decided. I can't say thank you enough to Stern, who invited us to his shipyard when we would have been left adrift. Dock, who's done a dirty job, and I can both start with a clean slate. The only way we can repay him is to support his business with our skills.”
There's a crumpled piece of paper inside. “Sea Mauville Company Song” is written on it. 1. The daybreak shines on Route 108. Wake up, our towering fort. For the bright future Hoenn, We won't take our days off. Dig through, dig out great energy. Ah, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville. 2. The bright light shines on Route 108. Intensely shiny, our fort. Swear your selfless devotion. Unionization is out of the question. Dig through, dig out great energy. Ah, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville. 3. Darkness descends on Route 108. Tonight again sleepless, our fort. Drive away our competitors. We won't take our overtime pay. Dig through, dig out great energy. Ah, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville.
It's a group photo of people in jumpsuits. They're all tanned, each striking a pose.
It's a picture of a guy with an impressive mustache and stomach. He's smiling with many men in jumpsuits in front of Sea Mauville.

A ragged jumpsuit is hung in the locker. Pokémon may have gnawed on it.
It's an old shelf. A shattered tea cup with printed letters “Adversity” is on the shelf.
There is a gigantic PC behind the locker that doesn't open. Moss is growing from the broken monitor.
A card is on the chair with warped legs. Some parts are missing. Sea Mauv—e Employee I— C—rd —a— —z— Ware— team R, Storage Group —1
A pick is resting against an old machine... It's huge like a horn of a Heracross, but it's very rusty.
There's a locker with a very dented door. Whether you push it or pull it, it won't move.
A lot of tattered comic books are piled high. When did they read these?

Isn't this place fun? I get chills just being here! And there are rumors about an awesome Pokémon living here!
Sniff, sniff... Just as I thought, a rare Pokémon must be hiding somewhere in this abandoned building. Girls are very sensitive to smell, so I know.
When I was young, I worked here. Even though it was closed for Pokémon's sake, looking at my old workplace deteriorating like this gives me mixed feelings.
Ah... I can't go farther... If my Pokémon knows the move Dive, I might be able to go farther.
Oh! You have Dive! I have my inner tube, so I can't dive. Ahaha.
Oh! You have Dive! I have my inner tube, so I can't dive. Ahaha.
The door is locked. It has “Room 1” written on it.
The door is locked. It has “Room 2” written on it.
The door is locked. It has “Room 4” written on it.
The door is locked. It has “Room 6” written on it.
@s used the [VAR ITEM2(0001)]! The key stuck fast in the keyhole, but the door opened!
Hey! Little kid over there!
I came here 'cause my uncle told me that there are extraordinary treasures in this abandoned building. Don't you know anything about them? Well, how would you know... But if you learn anything, tell me, kid. Understand?
I wonder how extraordinary the extraordinary treasures are. Hehehe... I'm excited like a kid in a candy store.
It's a perfect place for exploration, so I'm really excited! Rumor has it that there are awesome treasures here!
I don't know what it is for, but I found a key! I don't know what it is for, but do you want this?
Here it is!
Don't be shy. Take this!
I wonder what the key is for. It's exciting. If you find out, please let me know.
So that was the Key to Room 1! I couldn't read what was written on it. Once you find out what it is, it's a tad disappointing, isn't it? Give me back the excitement!
I heard this place used to collect something called e-n-e-r-g-y.
Sniff, sniff... Yes, yes! I can smell it. You must have met or caught a rare Pokémon around here, right? But this smell... It's different from the smell of any Pokémon in the Hoenn region.
There is a worn-out sign. Sea Mauville's 10 slogans for a cheerful and fun workplace. 01. Say good morning very loudly. 02. Don't bring Pokémon to your workplace. 03. Always arrive on time. Always stay late. 04. Lay your life on the line in safety checks. 05. Take joint responsibility for teamwork. 06. Obey your superior's orders absolutely. 07. Maintain top quality. Give up your sanity. 08. Worship and praise the founder. 09. Don't expect time off before you retire. 10. No need to think. Just work unceasingly.

The [VAR ITEM2(0000)] in your Bag seems to be glowing faintly...
I'm investigating this place Sea Mauville at Captain Stern's request. He wanted me to look for a Scanner while I'm here, but I haven't found anything like that. I suppose the only place I haven't checked yet is that lowest room you can only reach by diving underwater. But I just hate having the water close over my head...
Ahhh! Is that the Scanner? Hmm... Do you think you could deliver it to Captain Stern? I still have things I want to inspect while I'm here.
You delivered that Scanner for me! Thanks again! I heard about it from Captain Stern. He just contacted me a little while ago. It seems that when he checked the data on the Scanner, he got high-energy readings never seen in the Pokémon native to Hoenn! I'm not sure what it all means, but it sure is exciting! The thrill of research!
The door is locked. It has “Storage” written on it.
@s used the Storage Key! The key stuck fast in the keyhole, but the door opened!
...Hm? You want something?
Mmm... It's just not going at all.
Mmm... Haven't caught any Pokémon. But I guess I did catch this...
Mmm... I guess I'm not really waiting for a bite... It's really that I love times like this, out fishing on my own...
How's it going?
You caught anything?

Oh my, are you a tourist? I am a member of the nature preservation society that manages this site.
Is there anything you would like me to tell you about Sea Mauville?
This place was once a facility built to extract natural resources that can be found in the ocean. However, a certain event led to the facility's closure. Normally you would expect that an unnecessary facility like this one would be torn down. But an environmental survey carried out before new construction led to the awareness that a unique environment had risen here at Sea Mauville. As a result, the demolition plans were shelved, and this space was reborn as a Nature Preserve.
The most easily recognizable feature of Sea Mauville is this building, which now tilts precariously into the sea. After being exposed to the elements for so long, the building's support structures weathered and corroded, ultimately leaving the building in its current state. Please be careful where you step as you experience for yourself the awesome power of nature. Also note the mangroves growing in this area. They are extremely rare trees and can only be found here and around Mossdeep City. Lastly, I would like to point out the interior of the building has been largely untouched in the decades following Sea Mauville's closure—a fact that most of our visitors delight to experience.
Thank you very much. We are also fundraising for the preservation of Sea Mauville. Our request is $100 per visitor. Can we count on your support?
Thank you very much, and we hope you will continue to support our efforts in the future.
... We really hope we may look forward to your support in the future.
What is this place?
What is there to do?
I'm good.
Sea Mauville A Hoenn Region Protected Area
Muhuhuhu... Good, good. I like it—I really do. This atmosphere, like it's been forgotten in time...
I'm here surveying Sea Mauville at the request of Captain Stern.
A mysterious ring is floating in the air. A mystical presence seems to be lurking within it... Would you like to examine it?

Are you planning on going deep in there? How about bringing me back some Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells? I can make you something good if you bring me those items.
If you bring me four each of the Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells, I can make you a Shell Bell... You can get more every day.
Oh, hey! Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells! And enough of them, too! Would you like me to make you a Shell Bell with them?
All righty, then! I'll make you a Shell Bell right away. ... There! Done!
Have a Pokémon hold on to that. It'll love it, that's for certain. Why, the Shell Bell's chime... It's simply sublime! You can get more Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells every day, so I can always make more.
And... I'm not quite sure what this is, but I got this recently. If you like, please take this, too.
Oh... Is that so...? I wanted to make a Shell Bell...
You wouldn't have space in your Bag even if I were to make one for you. You should make some room and then come back for a Shell Bell.

Ah! @s!
I bet you must be surprised to see me in a place like this!
That promise that we made back then... Thank you for keeping your end of it.
It was really all thanks to you that I could make it this far, @s.
It was only because I lost to you back then that I could become even stronger.
I'm sure that you and your Pokémon must have had to overcome a lot, too... To make it all the way here. Right, @s?
Everyone's grown so much...
And now we'll finally get to see just what we all can do. Standing here facing you again gives me chills...
...But I won't give up! I won't lose anymore.
My Pokémon have given me the courage and strength to fight. I have to win for their sake!
So get ready... Here I come!
[~ 11]
... ...
Arghhh!!!
... ... ...Hah.
@s, you... And your Pokémon, too... Thank you for not holding back when you battled against us... For not holding back when you beat us...
And... Gallade... Everyone... Thank you so much...
I feel like I've been able to take another step forward thanks to you!
I couldn't beat you this time, @s. But I'll stay here and continue training. And one day... Look out! I swear I'll catch up to you one day! When I do, promise we'll battle again! That's a promise I intend to live up to!
[~ 19]
[~ 20]
[~ 21]
Oh! I know! I'll give you this to keep. I hope it will always remind you of your battle with me...and with Gallade and the rest of my team.
If you have a male Kirlia as one of your partners, @s, I hope that you might use that Dawn Stone on it for me.

Ugh...
Ahahaha!
How pathetic you appear now. The fool, Archie.
Ugh! Arghhh...
M-Maxie...you...!
Fuhahaha! Just as I predicted.
L-little scamp...
Even I, the great Maxie, have found myself wishing for something I cannot justify. And the illogical desire that I harbored was to have you present here at this moment.
Hahaha... And now that fool's wish has come true. Fantastic! Nothing could please me more!
I suppose I should make introductions... I present to you my incomparable partner, who will assist Team Magma in driving humanity forward to its next level!
The super-ancient Pokémon...Groudon!
Behold! This great form slumbering in defiance of even the broiling lava surrounding it!
...
So long have I waited for this day... Immeasurably long!
This foolish world has held back humanity's progress out of misguided idealism regarding the coexistence of humans and Pokémon. But this ancient creature can bring that to its rightful end, creating a new land upon which humanity may stride freely forward.
And now, you are the final obstacle remaining between me and my goals. It behooves me to use every tool at my disposal to eliminate you.
Fuhahaha!
Hah... Hah... Hahhh...
... Ah. Aha... Fuhahaha...
Splendid. Just splendid, my young Trainer.
No, it is more than that! I should be calling you my young hero! Believing until the very end that a world where humanity and Pokémon coexist must be the best... Rejecting my ideals without a second thought... Yes, watching you struggle desperately to halt the beginning of the world's end... You are undoubtedly a hero!
So noble... And yet. I will not yield! I will not bend! My ideals will not be shaken! My dream for the world's next step forward will never change!
Wait! Maxie!
Buh?! Tabitha?!
Do stop that now... Please! Maxie!
You just don't understand! What Groudon will bring about upon awakening is an end to the world!
Y-you dare—?!
Hyuhn?!
Humph. Did you think I had not noticed? That I had somehow failed to realize you were after my spot? Such a sad development indeed. To be betrayed by my number two...
In the end, there is only one being upon which I can depend! Now, Groudon! Absorb all of the power resting in this Red Orb, and reclaim yourself! Revert to your primal form!
Augh... You...
Gahahahaha! At last... AT LAST! I've finally done it!!! A new world for human evolution will be born!!! We shall stride forward!!!
Ohh... What have you done... Boss... What...
...Hm? A message from our members outside?
What is it? So the sun has turned mercilessly fierce in its heat. I should expect so. That is what I have long— No, what WE have long wished for.
What?! The heat is greater than simulations predicted? It will be a risk to our own safety if it continues?! That cannot be... It has only just awoken... Where is it getting so much power from? And how much more will it gain when it does undergo Primal Reversion... C-continue your readings! Then report back!
Boss?! Maxie?! Just what's happening on the surface?!
All that matters is... That I have used the Red Orb to awaken Groudon. And now... I will transform this planet to a land ideal for humanity.
Hey, Maxie. Looks like we underestimated the power of the super-ancient Pokémon... The power of Primal Reversion...
What...did you say?
Primal Groudon brings about an “end,” all right. But you don't get to choose what end. It's gonna drive every living thing on this planet to its death! The only thing waiting for us is despair. A despair we can't even run from. A despair that's gonna crush humanity. You blasted fool... And it's all happening 'cause you were cocky enough to think you could control the super-ancient Pokémon's power!
So the information we received from the Weather Institute was true... Boss Maxie! We'll never get anywhere just standing around here like this! There isn't a moment to spare! We must confirm the situation on the outside!
Child! You're coming, too! Hurry up!
Now that I have at last obtained the power of [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Groudon!
Indeed! Even Mega Evolution! Do not delude yourself that you and your Pokémon are the only ones capable of it. I must apologize for making you wait through our encounters at Mt. Chimney and Mt. Pyre without treating you to this sight. Brace yourself for my ultimate attack!
I will use the Red Orb to awaken Groudon, revert it to its primal form, and put an end to all else!
This is the time to take back the great Evolution you lost in the ancient past! Reclaim the possibility you once held!
Kahahahaha! GAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Urk...
Bwahahaha!
You're looking pretty pathetic now, aren't you? The great Maxie!
Ugh...
A-Archie...you...
Bwahahaha!
Y-you, child...
Well, if it isn't my little adversary! I can't even find the words to praise you as you deserve.
Sometimes it's best to keep things simple. All I'll say is you met my expectations, scamp!
And I'm not just talking about today, but everything you've done up till now. And that's why you'll get the honor of meeting my new partner before anyone else living in this world!
The super-ancient Pokémon...KYOGRE!!!
How 'bout that?! That beautiful form so long resting at peace within the azure sea!
...
I've been waiting so long for this day to come.
We humans have disregarded Pokémon and nature both in our endless pursuit of our own desires and needs... And in the process, we've created this broken and disordered world... But this is the day when I finally obtain the power to return everything to how it once was—to return to our beginnings! Now that I can release the ancient power!
And now, you are the last token resistance that's trying to ruin my day. I'll use everything my team and I have to crush you once and for all!
GRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Hah... Hah... Ahh...
... Ah. Aha... Ahahahaha...
Perfect! You're just as great as any little hero trying to save the world oughta be!
But it changes nothing! I can't give up now! I can't!
I WILL use the power of this Blue Orb to awaken Kyogre at last! Then I'll return everything in this world to its original, pure state!!
Archie!
Shelly?!
That's enough!
Can't you see that the world you dream of and the world that Kyogre will create are two completely different places?!
[~ 26]
[~ 27]
Shelly... I always believed that you at least would understand my dreams...
But no! In the end, the only one I can depend on is you, Kyogre! Absorb all the power resting in this Blue Orb, and reclaim yourself! Revert to your primal form!
No... That...
Bwahahahaha! At last... AT LAST! I've finally done it!!! It hasn't even finished reversion, and it still has this much power!!! With this I can return everything to its natural beginning! It's time at last!
What...have you done...
Is that the crew outside?
What is it...? Oh? So the great deluge has begun... Bwahahahaha! But of course it has! That is exactly what I have—
What...? What do you mean far more than we thought?! It can't be... Then if it completes its Primal Reversion... N-never mind that! Just keep an eye on it!
Archie! What's going on outside?!
All that matters is... That I have used the Blue Orb to awaken Kyogre... And now... I will return this world to its natural state... The state that is best for Pokémon!
Archie. It appears you have made a grave error regarding Kyogre's powers.
What...did you say?
The “beginning” that Primal Kyogre brings about... The way that it resets the world... It starts by driving every living thing on this planet to death first! This path leads only to an inescapable despair that cannot be withstood. That is all you have brought us. This is what comes of the madness of thinking that you could ever control the super-ancient Pokémon's power!
I knew it. ... We just need to get out of here! Standing around complaining isn't going to solve anything!
You, too! Well, hurry up!
The ancient power of [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Kyogre!
Oh? And...Mega Evolution? Did ya think that you and your Pokémon are the only ones who can use it? Let me show you now what I didn't get the chance to show you at Mt. Chimney... This is the true power of my team!
Now! AWAKEN, KYOGRE! RETURN EVERYTHING TO THE WAY IT WAS!!
This is the time to take back the great Evolution you lost in the ancient past!
Bwahahahahahaha! Bwaha! AHAHAHAHAHA!

It's a model of a ship! It seems quite old, but it must be well cared for... It's absolutely spotless.
It's a showcase! There is a lock on it, so you can't open it.
It's the Team Aqua flag!
...
Bro... Sorry.
...
Archie... It looks like Matt feels sorry for what he's done.
... It's unforgivable.
Aah... Bro...
Absolutely unforgivable!
Umm, Archie...
I can't forgive... What I've done!
Huh?!
I drove my own loyal crew to such despair as this... I have no right to call myself a leader anymore.
I'm... I'm sorry, Matt. I truly am.
Ooh...ahh... Bro...
I'm planning to start everything over from scratch, Matt. What happened back then with Kyogre... And what happened this time... Look, you can't do anything if you're all wrapped up in what you believe. Team Aqua or Team Magma... Pokémon or people... There's no reason why we've gotta pick just one of 'em. It might be a pain, it might even be a bit scary, but we've gotta take that step into the unknown. Mix with people who aren't like us... That's the kind of Team Aqua that I want us to be from now on. ... You think you can be a part of that kind of Team Aqua? Matt...
Oh, oh! You... You bet I will!
I can't believe these two. What do they think they're doing standing there with their faces all wet with tears.
Well... I guess it could be worse.
Guwahhh?!
All right! And the winner is Zinnia!
Archie... Are you...OK?
Ugh...
I'll be keelhauled! How did I get beat by this little slip of a girl?
Murrr!♪ Murrr!♪
Oh, oh, what's this?! Aren't you a happy girl, Aster! ♪
Just what I'd expect of my daughter! We're so in sync! Ahahaha!
You... Who are you?
Who am I? That's a surprisingly difficult question.
... I couldn't become who I was supposed to be, so who does that make me now? ...
Haha! Whatever, right? Enough with the introspection and the soul searching...
You there! @s! Don't just stand there like a stick in the mud. Come on over and say hi.
You!
Scamp? But why are you...
Isn't it obvious? He's the hero, right? Here to save the world again.
Isn't it obvious? She's the heroine, right? Here to save the world again.
Oops. But looks like [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's a bit too late this time. If only you'd been here just one minute earlier!
Zinnia grabbed the Key Stone away from Archie!
Wha—?!
Archie! Hang in there!
There now. I'd say this Key Stone is mine.
We finally got everything, Aster.
Murrr?
Now we can do it... The summoning.
We will summon Rayquaza!
Well then, looks like my job here is done. So don't mind me while I excuse myself.
Oh. @s?
I really hope you'll come chasing after me, you know? We'll be heading to that ancient tower, sealed since primal times, the Sky Pillar.
If you don't know what that is, well, ask that former Champ of yours. He'll know what I'm talking about.
Find me there!
Murrr!
...Oh man! What makes her think she can just do whatever she wants and then hightail it out of here?!
... Little scamp...
Heh... Fine...
I guess it's just fate. That you showed up now of all times.
...
Shelly... Give it to the kid.
Shelly... Give it to the girl.
...What?! I-is that OK?!
Yeah... What could I do with a Mega Stone anyway, now that I've lost my Key Stone?
...I understand.
The Sharpedonite... Make sure your Sharpedo holds on to it tightly.
You take my power, scamp... I'm giving it to you.
That woman... I don't think she's just any old Trainer. Not with the way she controlled those Dragon-type Pokémon of hers...
I got no idea what she's planning... But I think you're our best bet at stopping her now, little scamp. Do that for me.
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app rang on your PokéNav Plus!
Steven: ...@s! Are you all right?!
Steven: ...@s! Are you all right?!
Steven: ... Steven: Is that right... I never even imagined... Steven: The Key Stone... The Sky Pillar... And the Draconid people... Steven: So that's it... I begin to see the line connecting these dots. Steven: I think we need to meet up at once to discuss what we should do next. Steven: I'll be waiting at the Space Center. Up on 2F. Steven: Do hurry.
...Kzt!
That crazy lady... She said that the former Champion would know what she was about... You'd know where to find him, right?
Go get her for Archie!
Little scamp... Naw... It's @s, isn't it?
Little scamp... Naw... It's @s, isn't it?
Make yourself at home, all right? You can kick back and relax here.
Make yourself at home, all right? You can kick back and relax here.
Oh my goodness me! Thanks for coming! Thanks to you, it looks like we of Team Aqua will be able to take a step in a new direction. Thank you kindly for everything!
Oh! Isn't that that kid I love?! Thanks to you, it looks like my bro and everybody else in Team Aqua will be able to power up even more! The gratitude we feel is overwhelming! Thanks!

It's an old radio and cassette recorder! A cassette tape labeled “Bro Special, Vol. 7” is in the deck.
It's a well-worn training bag. “5,000 punches a day” is written in big letters across the center of the bag.
It's a Wailmer Doll! It has a sour-sweet scent.
There is a picture of a boy with a shaved head, a girl with black hair, and a Pokémon with three notes attached to its head. “The 7th day of the —th month, —002. With Arc—e and —rachi.” The letters at the edge of the picture are faded and hard to read...
It's the Team Aqua flag! It has a slightly salty scent...

Oh! I knew you'd come!
You're the first punk ever to sneak into this hideout and make it this far! I expected nothing less from a crumb like you!
But I've got some bad news for you! We already completely finished upgrading the ship!
Look at that drill! As long as we've got that thing, we could KO the seal over the Seafloor Cavern with one punch!
My bro Archie's in the ship! Come at me! If you take me out fast, you might be able to catch up to him!
Before you do, though... We need to settle once and for all who's stronger, you and your sorry Pokémon, or me and my not-so-sorry Pokémon!
...Hoo! ...Haaahh!
I'm... Heating up!
Hooah! Full on! I'm burning up!
Me! You! Pokémon! Mixing it up! Dueling!
Well! Welll! Wellllll! Let's battle it out until we've got nothing left!
Hah... Hah... Hah...
Bro! It's all...on you...now...
...
While we were battling it out...
My bro Archie finished getting ready...
...
I have only one hope...
For my bro Archie to finish doing what he set out to do... That's all...
My bro Archie is everything to me... I live to serve my bro...
...All right, then. You took me out, so I'll give you an idea of what the world will be like if my bro has his way.
My bro Archie is headed for the big blue sea that stretches out from Lilycove City. Deep beneath the surface is the Seafloor Cavern. That's where the world my bro hopes to create... Where the beginnings of the primordial world will be felt...
Regular people and Pokémon can't make it there, though. How could you get there...
Why don't you look around in towns by the sea and use your own thick head to think about it?
They're blueprints that read, “Proposed Alterations to Submarine Explorer 1.”
Instructions on how to use the panel that controls the locks are written here.
Teeheehee!
We finally meet again.
Hm? Ah... Is this the first time we've met?
Nincompoop! It doesn't matter!
Brace yourself! We'll show you the power of quintuplets!
Hah, hah, hah...
We lost...
It's odd. I can't believe five of us couldn't defeat just one Trainer. Did you cheat? Grumble, grumble...
Nincompoop! Stop whining!
Our leaders are ahead! You have no chance to defeat them!
Our leader's room isn't here. You're the second person to make this mistake. There was also a girl with a Whismur.
The girl who came here asking where our leader's room was... I heard she was an intruder. I probably shouldn't have told her where it was. Archie will give me noogies...

It's a machine for irradiating a Meteorite with lasers. It seems experiments were being conducted until just this moment. The surroundings of the machine smell like something burned.
PROJECT AZOTH File No. 2 We intend to analyze the power of the ultimate weapon used in Kalos 3,000 years ago and work on the development of a drill weapon utilizing the technology. The Seafloor Cavern is sealed by the power of a Legendary Pokémon. The only way to gain access to the cavern is to break the seal with power that exceeds that of the Pokémon. According to the report from the Petalburg recon team, Devon Corporation holds the secret of the technology of the ultimate weapon. We will dedicate all our resources to obtaining this technology.
It's a machine for testing the durability of the suit. Touch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say, “Give it a walloping” “Throw a lot of weight on it” “Wring it tightly” “Drop it from really high up” “Burn it severely” “Submerge it intensely” “Thrash it hard” “Knead it massively”
“Danger! Please don't play inside.” “Caution! It's super dangerous! Really! I mean it!” “If something bad happens because you didn't believe me, don't blame me!” ...That's what's written on a note tacked to the wall.
Sturdy protective gear is attached to the machine.
Beep, beep, beep. I AM AN A.I. MY PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUA SUIT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUA SUIT IS 120 PERCENT COMPLETE. CONGRATULATIONS. THE AQUA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND WATER PRESSURE AT ANY DEPTH. THE AQUA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND THE G-FORCES OF THE SECOND COSMIC VELOCITY. IT IS AN ULTRA SUPER SUIT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, THE INSIDE OF THE SUIT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS SLIGHTLY HUMID AND WET. ...sorry about that... THIS CONCLUDES MY STATUS REPORT. GOOD-BYE. Beep, beep, beep.
It's a machine that controls lasers to irradiate Meteorites. Touch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say, “Fire the laser beam delicately.” “Fire the laser beam a little bit more.” “Fire the laser beam fairly judiciously.” “Fire the laser beam like whoa.”
Meteorites... Natural energy... Super-ancient Pokémon... Here, we're conducting experiments to understand how they all relate and create a Blue Orb artificially. But...we haven't had much success. It may be too difficult for humans to solve.
The Aqua Suit is the fruit of the collaboration of Devon's and our science and technology. If not for Shelly, who used to work for Devon, the invention would never have materialized.
I'm not slacking off! I'm facing a very difficult decision. What drink to take with me on my 12-hour lookout shift— Fresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade...

PROJECT AZOTH File No. 1 The goal of Project AZOTH is to return the world— return everything—to the beginning. In order to further the project, we must proceed with research on Kyogre's Primal Reversion. Primal Reversion is a potential of Pokémon Evolution, a potential different from Mega Evolution. Mega Evolution is made possible by the energy of people and Pokémon. Primal Reversion is made possible by natural energy. In Primal Reversion, Kyogre absorbs natural energy into its body, thereby increasing its power dramatically. Both states significantly enhance Pokémon's power: the difference lies in the source of the required energy.
Expanding the sea... What exactly do we have to do to achieve that?
I guess we have to keep squirting water, right? Pfloosh! Pfloosh!
Each person's bed reveals a little something of their character... And reveals a unique odor signature, as well!
Taking a break is important, isn't it? Team Aqua doesn't have fixed working hours nor specific break times, so if we wanted, we could take a break all day long.
Hey, you—no, no, no. This is Team Aqua's library, where documents on our highly confidential plan are stored. No outsiders are allowed to enter.

There's a bed. Let's take a rest.

What? What? What do you want with Team Aqua? Our boss isn't here! He's gone off to steal a submarine! ... “Where did he go?” Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
We, Team Aqua, decided to make a fresh start with Archie!
That Trainer with black bobbed hair... She was incredibly strong. But our leader is beyond the rooms full of warp panels. It's not that easy to get there...
Finally, Team Aqua was able to make a fresh start!
Mumble, mumble... Staying on my feet all day makes my feet swell. I hate it...
Mumble, mumble... I stopped whining about standing all day, and it doesn't bother me anymore.
We're insanely busy preparing for the new Team Aqua.
A woman with a Whismur is...inside...
What shall I do from now on? I have plenty of time, so I'll take my time figuring it out.
What? What? What do you want with Team Aqua? Our boss isn't here! He's on his way to Mt. Pyre on Route 122! ... “Why did he go?” Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with Team Aqua? Our boss isn't here! He's on his way to Slateport City! ... “Why did he go?” Wahaha! Do you really think I'd tell you something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with Team Aqua? Well, we don't mind you coming here for no reason, though.
What...what...what is that Dragon-type-Pokémon user... Her strength... It's astonishing. Would you say she's stronger than Archie?
Honestly, making a fresh start is a bother. It's too hard. But if all of us work together, we might be able to make it. Team Aqua is the team that makes me feel that way.
[~ 15]

Black bob hair... Actually, she's my type.
One bad thing happens after another— but we have to get through this.
Archie seems to be fine for now. What a relief...

Yo.
I thought something was a bit noisy, and who is it but the usual scamp!
Sorry, scampo, but I'm afraid I just don't have time to play with you right now.
The Blue Orb that's long been enshrined here at Mt. Pyre... It belongs to Team Aqua now!
...Ma-a-att!
Oh! Boss!
How about you do a favor for our lively little visitor, and keep h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer entertained?
You'd better use your full strength, too, so you don't offend our honored guest!
Bwahahahaha! With this Blue Orb in my hands, I won't even need the power of the Meteorite to awaken the beast from the deep! All I need now is a way to get to the place where it sleeps... All I have to do is get that submarine they're making in Slateport! Come on, boys! We're for Slateport City!
All right then, until the Boss makes his getaway, I'll be your opponent!
Oohh... Ha! Ha! Hah!
That was fun! I knew you'd show me a good time!
I look forward to facing you again someday!
Aye, me, what disaster... The Blue Orb...stolen from our safekeeping...
The Blue Orb and Red Orb must never be separated. They belong together...
Mmm...
I will entrust the remaining Red Orb to you, young one.
And I beg you... Chase after those thieves and take back their orb! That wretched leader of theirs... I'm sure he said they were headed for Slateport City next...
The Red Orb I gave you, and the Blue Orb that they stole... Having the two separated can only lead to disaster... I'm sure their leader said they would head to Slateport next...
So it has happened... Kyogre has been awoken... And the mysterious orb that transformed it into its true form—its Primal Reversion— it was the Blue Orb that was stolen away from us... My people first unearthed it in Sootopolis's Cave of Origin. Perhaps Kyogre has some tie to the Cave of Origin...
So it has happened... Groudon has been awoken... And the mysterious orb that transformed it into its true form—its Primal Reversion— it was the Red Orb that was stolen away from us... My people first unearthed it in Sootopolis's Cave of Origin. Perhaps Groudon has some tie to the Cave of Origin...

Mt. Pyre exists to soothe the spirits of Pokémon that have passed on... From so high up, we can look down upon Hoenn. Such a view must bring peace even to those lost Pokémon... Is it coincidence that you are here? Will you hear my tale? A tale long told in the Hoenn region?
It happened long, long ago... The world was wracked by an unceasing battle between Kyogre, the Pokémon of the sea, and Groudon, the Pokémon of the land... Kyogre raising huge waves and carving out oceans... Groudon raising mountains and creating continents... Their fierce duel raged without end. The world was assaulted by vicious rains and merciless heat in turn. Only one power was great enough to quell this terrible outpouring. That of the Blue Orb and the Red Orb. The light which poured from the Red Orb calmed Kyogre in its fury. The light which swelled from the Blue Orb quieted Groudon in its rage. The two, now docile, dove deep into the sea and disappeared from human eyes...

I see... Well, that, too, is fine...
[~ 55]
Hmph...
So it was you...
I'm sorry I had to postpone my defeat of you at Mt. Chimney. And now, I am sorry that I have to postpone it once more. I cannot afford to waste even a single second now.
For the Red Orb which has long been enshrined here at Mt. Pyre... Now belongs to me, the great Maxie!
Courtney.
...Ha.
You must see to it that our dear visitor is not neglected due to my inability to battle now...
Do be so kind as to battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer with the full measure of your strength... and crush this [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl so that [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she will never again for a single moment dream of defying our team!
Fufufu... With this Red Orb in my possession, I have no need for the power of the Meteorite to awaken the beast from the deep! All that I need now is a way to reach the place where it sleeps... The only task remaining is obtaining the submarine being constructed in Slateport! We move out at once, team! Our next destination...Slateport City!
... ...Analyzing.
...Hah. ♪
...Again? That's unanticipated. ...I knew it. You...are interesting! ...Haha. ♪
I'm looking forward to... I'm looking forward to... When we...can meet again.
Aye, me, what disaster... The Red Orb... Stolen from our safekeeping...
The Red Orb and Blue Orb must never be separated. They belong together...

Oh?
You... What are you doing in a place like this?
Hmmm, I see. I usually train here. Today I had planned to come see my grandma here, though. Well, good luck with your training! See you in the Pokémon League!
Oh, I see. That must be why my grandma was talking about you earlier. It looks like you made a lasting impression on my grandma. Well, I guess I'll be on my way. See you in the Pokémon League!

It's not good enough yet. For a final resting place that my Pokémon Meow and I will be in, this is not good enough.
Why is he so particular about it? Once you die, everything will be gone...
A text inscribed on a tombstone honoring a deceased person or a Pokémon is called an epitaph. I've been contemplating what to write in my epitaph. I have so many great achievements that I'm at a complete loss.
The words “Final Resting Place for Pokémon Meow and Me” are inscribed on it.

I'm so old that all my tears have dried up completely. But my memories flood my mind all the time.
Because I loved my Pokémon very much, I spent a lot of money to get a good spot. You know, you can measure the depth of love by the money you spend.

It's natural for people and Pokémon to be buried in graves once they die. But I heard that's not the usual way in some places in the world.

A Secret Spot protected by a boulder like that has gotta be full of adventure! And here! Have a little gift from me, since I'm in such a fine mood today!
That move there will change its effect based on where you are. And more important, doesn't it have an awesome name? Welp, I guess it's time for me to be off lookin' for another location for a Secret Base. I hate to say good-bye, but this is it for today, pal! If you wanna see me again, come by the Secret Base Guild in Fortree!

When all that mountain climbing has made you tired, try Lava Cookies. They're Mt. Chimney's local specialty. Try one. They're just $200.

This mysterious machine... It gives no response whatsoever.
The power contained in the Meteorite...
If we merge the explosive energy contained within the planet's core with the Meteorite's power...
I remember those eyes. And the indomitable will that seems to burn behind them. Ahhh. Now I recall. You are the one who defied us at Slateport's Oceanic Museum. And, your presence here tells me that you have defeated Tabitha. Yes, I see now that the stirring of interest I felt was not misplaced. Hmph. You show true promise. Fine. I will attempt to educate you.
Thousands of years ago, there lived a most powerful being that was said to be capable of creating new lands on the planet. The power which we in Team Magma seek— This power, which can expand the available landmass, belongs to a legendary and super- ancient Pokémon. Though now it slumbers, having lost the source of its power and been trapped in a deep sleep.
So what is it that we must do to awaken this slumbering giant? Our research has led us here, to Mt. Chimney. Yes, here...to this very Meteorite. If we create the right conditions, we should find ourselves able to alter this Meteorite's qualities. Yes, even into a Mega Stone. Even into a Key Stone. And here, at Mt. Chimney— Hmph... I should not say too much. That is the end of today's lesson.
Now then. I believe it is time we begin. The time for the purge has come. I do believe that I made myself quite clear when we were last in Slateport. I warned you that any fool standing in our way would be met without mercy!
I will bury you by my own hand. I hope you appreciate this honor!
[~ 17]
Oh? So you repulsed the great Maxie in battle. Haha... You never fail to entertain me!
An excellent start! This time, permit me to unleash my full strength! Once you've tasted my Pokémon's Mega Evolved power, you will say good-bye to your last shred of hope!
Hm?
Yes, it's me. ... Oh? Then it is Mt. Pyre.
I understand. I will come at once.
I am sorry to cut our battle short, but I'm afraid I must excuse myself. Such rudeness demands reparation. Take this Meteorite with my apologies. You may do with it what you like.
And I will not again forget the face of the Trainer who managed to thwart me in battle!
Huh? If it ain't that little scamp! But blast that Maxie! He just escaped us!
And he just left behind the Meteorite that he's been crazy about finding?
Hyahyahya?! It's you! You're the one who tried to interrupt me, Tabitha, at Meteor Falls!
D-d-do you intend to get in my way once more? Unngh! You're really...
really, really, really, really, really, really...
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really...
reeeallllyyyyy... ...an obnoxious child, aren't you?!
Ahh... Ahh...
I will...crush you. So that you...never get in my way...again.
[~ 34]
I knew you would be strong.
What a shame, though! The Meteorite we got from Professor Whoever is already in our Boss's hands! Where's the Boss, you ask? Ah, yes, yes, right this way! Oh, I do hope that you can be shown Team Magma's true power!
Ahya! Ahyahyahyahya!
The Boss is right this way! Oh, I do hope that you can be shown Team Magma's true power!
[~ 39]

[~ 41]
That annoying Team Aqua... They always mess with our plans!
Meteorites pack amazing power!
[~ 44]
Stay out of our way, OK? We're trying to enlarge the landmass for the good of everybody!
Yeah! Douse them in fire!
Go! Stomp Team Aqua! And expand the land!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Get out of my blasted way, ye scurvy Team Magma knaves! Or face a keelhauling!
Confound the lot of you! Let me through, you bilge rats!
Oh no... Team Magma outnumbers us! We can't keep up with them!
If they expand the land, there'll be fewer habitats for Water Pokémon!
Team Magma wants to expand the landmass. How's that for insane?
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
The great swell of power that sleeps deep in the magma...
And it's the key to controlling the super-ancient Pokémon's power?
Ah! You... Uh... No... Oh! Now I know how I know you! You're the little scamp that got in our way in Slateport's museum! If you made it here to me, you musta swept right past Shelly, huh? Heh...heheheh... Krmph! Bwahahahahaha! I figured you were a big deal the first time I laid eyes on you, but...whoa!
Heheh. Well, since you are the real deal, I s'pose I could let you in on just what's going on. See, this Meteorite that I just got from good old Professor High-an'-Mighty back there... With the right bit of work, it seems we could turn it into a real nice, valuable bit. Like maybe a Mega Stone. Or maybe...even a Key Stone. And as long as we're here at Mt. Chimney...
Hyup! Bwahahahahah! Look what I nearly went an' did! If I give away all my secrets, all the thrill'd be gone from our relationship! I think I'll just leave you hanging here.
Well... It's not the details that matter any old how. We've got a thing we gotta do, ya see. From our point of view, scamp, you're a dirty villain who's gotten in our way one time too many. I'm still leader of Team Aqua, so I'm afraid it's the rope's end for you and your Pokémon.
Now come!
[~ 72]
Heheheh. Ya little scamp! I knew you were the real deal!
Brilliant! Then my team won't hold back this time! Mega Evolution, how I've missed you! It's been ages since we got to let loose!
Tch. Scamp, I'm gonna have to ask you to hold that thought. I've gotta use my time-out.
Huh? That you, Matt? You have the worst timing— What? Hoh! So Mt. Pyre's the real— Got it. Guess that orb's not just some fairy tale after all!
All right! I'm on my way!
Sorry, scamp. When you're a grown-up, y'see, sometimes things crop up. Gotta put our battle on hold till next time. Take this. Should help keep ya busy till we settle the score. Have fun with it, hey?
Let's meet again somewhere. I'll be sure to remember that face.
I've seen you before, child. It seems you are not to be trifled with, if you repelled Archie in battle.
What is that fool up to now? He abandoned the Meteorite that he sought so persistently?
What are you doing here?!
Did you follow us all the way here from Meteor Falls?! Ha! Well hey, good job, kid.
OK. I admit it.
You are quite the Trainer. And...
To Archie... me... and all of Team Aqua, your existence is annoying!
The world Archie dreams of would be a utopia for Pokémon. I can't let you get in the way of someone who's pushing on toward a perfect world!
Prepare yourself! This will finally be the time that I leave that cute face of yours swollen and crying!
[~ 89]
Uh. Are you telling me you've upped your game even more since last time?
You're a brat with a bright future...
My Pokémon and I don't have any strength left to fight... Go on... Go and be destroyed by Archie.
Go on... Go and be destroyed by Archie.

All right! If three of us work together, we can even stop the Team Magma Leader!
All right! Drench 'em!
[~ 103]
Ugh! Impudent fools! You Team Aqua curs dare to impede the great Maxie?!
Impertinent...little...imbeciles!
Oh no... Team Aqua outnumbers us! We can't keep up with them!
If they expand the sea, there'll be fewer habitats for Pokémon and people!
Team Aqua wants to expand the sea. How's that for insane?

If you keep going on down this mountain route, there's a place called Lavaridge Town. You should rest before you go.
The energy contained within Mt. Chimney! And the power of the Meteorite! We in Team Aqua are gonna get it all for ourselves! Wa ha ha ha!

No! Could it be possible that he has confirmed the existence of the orbs at last?
Ngh! Again, I find myself outmaneuvered. What a terrible miscalculation!

Hello, have you seen any Pokémon called Shroomish around here? I really love that Pokémon.
I was going to ambush you, but you had to dawdle in Petalburg Woods forever, didn't you? I got sick of waiting, so here I am!
You! Devon researcher! Hand over those papers!
Aiyeeeh! You're a Pokémon Trainer, aren't you? You've got to help me, please!
Hunh? What do you think you're doing? What, you're going to protect him? No one who crosses Team Aqua gets any mercy, not even a kid! Come on and battle me!

Whew... That was awfully close! Thanks to you, he didn't rob me of these important papers. I know! I'll give you this as my thanks!
And with this, I'll restore your Pokémon's health. It's another technical advance that I'm proud of!
You had your Pokémon's HP restored!
...Ah! Didn't that Team Aqua thug say they were after something in Rustboro, too?

Yo, there! Your Pokémon doing OK? If your Pokémon are weak and you want to avoid battles, you should stay out of tall grass.
Sometimes, there are things on the ground even if you can't see them. That's why I always check where I'm walking.
Oh, the thing you have! It's a PokéNav Plus! That means you're a Trainer. Then you should try this item.
It's a Miracle Seed. If a Pokémon holds that item, its Grass-type moves become stronger. Besides Miracle Seed, I think there are other convenient items for Pokémon to hold.
Trainer Tips Any Pokémon that appears even once in a battle is awarded Exp. Points. To raise a weak Pokémon, put it at the top of the team list. As soon as a battle starts, switch it out. It will earn Exp. Points without being exposed to any harm.
Trainer Tips In addition to Hit Points (HP), Pokémon have Power Points (PP) that are used to make moves during battle. If a Pokémon runs out of PP, it must be taken to a Pokémon Center.
...This is the Petalburg recon team checking in.
I'm afraid I have to begin with an apology, Ms. Courtney... It's not good news...
I'm afraid I have to begin with an apology, Mr. Matt... It's not good news...
The mission is a no-go... A little something cropped up and got in the way...
...Roger that.
...Got it. Will do.
I'll continue investigating that energy we detected.
... ...Phew!
But that kid sure had some promise as a Trainer, I'd say.

...Mm-hmm.
So in the ancient world, their primal forms once held this much power...? The super-ancient Pokémon... What terrible strength...
But this appearance here... It seems somehow different from Mega Evolution... Hmm. It seems my questions will not be answered today.
Hm?
You are...?
...
Ah, I see. It's a pleasure, @s.
Ah, I see. It's a pleasure, @s.
My apologies. My name is Steven.
I'm interested in rare stones, so I travel here and there. Today my journey brought me here, but what about you?
Oh? A letter for me?
@s gave Steven the letter [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she had been entrusted with!
Why, thank you...
It must have been some trouble to track me down. I suppose I must repay you in some way.
Let me see... I will give you this TM. Please accept it. It contains my favorite move, Steel Wing.
If you don't mind me asking... Do you feel anything in particular when you look up at this wall?
A primal world, lost thousands of years in the past... A Legendary Pokémon of tremendous power became humanity's greatest threat... The terror aroused by that power is clear to see in this ancient artwork.
...Yes. But not all power is terrible. Your Pokémon are clearly quite capable as well.
Looking at you all together... I think that you have in you what it takes to become a Pokémon League Champion. As long as you keep training, that is.
Good luck to you. I must be going now.
Hm, hm, hm. Well, seems like it's true. It really is just like the wall painting there. This one shows Primal Reversion... While that one shows Mega Evolution... I guess that proves it once and for all.
Our great ancestors once lived here, too.
The ancestors who passed down through me the knowledge of how to protect the world... How to avert the threat that will appear from space, as long was foretold... From a place higher even than the heavens...
...Mum?
What is it, Aster?
Oh?
We do seem to meet an awful lot, @s.
Are you also interested in this old painting?
Or are you here for the other? For one of the Meteorite Shards that can serve as a source of power for the Legendary Pokémon that lives in the heavens above.
Either way... You know I adore you.
That's it! I can't help it! I have to battle you!
I'll play nice, though, and ask first... You're ready to battle me, right?
Fine, fine. I ge-e-et it. I'll wait. I want to see you at your best, y'know. So go get ready!
That's my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!
Now let's do it! Give me a good taste of everything you and your Pokémon have to offer!
Niiice! Real nice, @s! Ohhh, I really felt that one! Full points to you!
That settles it! You get this Meteorite Shard as a reward!
[~ 41]
... Hey... The actions that you're taking now... Are they based on the ideals you cling to? Or are they based on actual truths? And if they are... How much of the truth do you think you know?
...Mum?
Yes, ma'am! Moving out! Such a spoiled girl you are, Aster...
So what'll be our next stop, hmm, sweetie?
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app rang on your PokéNav Plus!
Steven: ...@s.
Steven: ...@s.
Steven: Were you able to find the Meteorite Shard that we need? Steven: If you were able to secure it, could you hurry back to us at the Mossdeep Space Center? Steven: I'm afraid we don't seem to have much time left... Steven: ...I'll be waiting for you.
...Kzt!
It is a cave painting depicting a giant Pokémon-like creature wreaking havoc. There is a symbol resembling an α on each of the beast's two arms...

Teach that TM Flash to a Pokémon and use it. It lights up even the inky darkness of caves.
Hey, hey! Cutting in line is no bueno.
The mural ahead... We can't figure out what's painted there, but that makes ruin enthusiasts like me even more curious about it. It looks as if a huge Pokémon is painted on it, but we've never seen such a Pokémon. It's sooooo intriguing and fascinating!
The mural ahead has drawn a lot of attention lately. The other day, Team Something in red or blue suits came here in numbers.
A mural covers the entire wall. The painting depicts the life of people and creatures that look like Pokémon.

Pi pikwee!
Grah, keelhaul it all! This hostage Pokémon turned out to be worthless! And to think I made a getaway... into this tunnel to nowhere! And you! Now you're here to battle me. Really?
[~ 3]
This is plain not right... The boss told me this would be a slick-and-easy job to pull. All I had to do was steal some parts from Devon. Tch! You want 'em back that badly, then take 'em!
Peeko! Am I glad to see you're safe!
My Peeko owes her life an' freedom to you, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss! They call me Mr. Briney. And you are?
Ah, so it's @s, is it now! Then I sincerely thank you, @s! If there's ever a thing I can do to help you in turn, don't you hesitate to tell me. If I'm to be found, it will always be at my cottage by the sea near Petalburg Woods.
Come, Peeko! High time we're under way to home!
Pikwee!
... Why can't I keep digging? Is the boulder too hard? My beloved girlfriend lives in Verdanturf Town, just beyond here... If Rustboro and Verdanturf were joined by this tunnel, I could visit her every day... But this... What am I to do?
To get from Rustboro to Verdanturf, you need to go to Dewford, then pass through Slateport and Mauville...
Wow! You shattered those boulders blocking the way. To show you how much I appreciate it, I'd like you to have this!
I found that when I was digging for the tunnel. I felt like there's some mysterious power coming from it, but I don't think I could do a thing with it.
Wanda! Now I can see you anytime!
That's...that's wonderful! Come on. Let me take you to my place so you can rest.
On the other side of this rock... My boyfriend labors day after day. He...he's not just digging this tunnel to come see me. He works his hands raw and rough for the benefit of everyone.

It's a cracked boulder. A Pokémon may be able to break it.
Y-your Pokémon! It can use Rock Smash?! Please, kid! Use Rock Smash and break up these boulders!
Th-thank you so much!
Oh... I s-see...
If only we had a Pokémon that could use Rock Smash. If we asked it, it could break up these boulders in no time flat!
Y-your Pokémon! It can use Rock Smash?! Please! Use Rock Smash and break up these boulders!
Thank you so much for doing this!
Oh... OK... That's disappointing. But it's up to you...

@s. We have the Meteorite Shard. And I have come to understand many things, as I suspected might happen.
@s. We have the Meteorite Shard. And I have come to understand many things, as I suspected might happen.
Allow me to introduce you. The honorable lady you see before you is a descendant of the ancient Draconids.
Yes, I am one of the Draconid people. One of those ancient folk tasked with passing down the knowledge of Mega Evolution—with the great lore of Lord Rayquaza, who was the beginning of all.
Since times long gone, Hoenn has repeatedly suffered great disasters. At times, the destruction took the form of a huge meteoroid, which fell upon our land from distant space. At other times, the Primal Reversions of our own super-ancient Pokémon brought us to the brink of destruction. Each time, Lord Rayquaza has saved us from doom.
The chosen Lorekeeper, standing before a stone that shone with rainbow light, offered up a wish to the great one. And Lord Rayquaza's body was suffused with a brilliant light and transformed. In its transformed state, Rayquaza's power was more devastating than ever before, overcoming even the super-ancient Pokémon with all their primal power.
A rainbow-colored stone... An invocation from the Lorekeeper... And a Rayquaza unlike any ever seen... I see. It does resemble what we know of the process of Mega Evolution...
Yes, it does indeed. A Pokémon, a person, a stone of power. The bonds that tie them all together... The transformation of the Pokémon that occurs as a result of this phenomenon was called “Mega Evolution” by later peoples.
So the mechanism for Mega Evolution was discovered as a result of the first meeting between humanity and Rayquaza... Hmmmm. But I have one last question. That “Lorekeeper” you spoke of...
The Lorekeeper is the one who has inherited the knowledge and power to summon Lord Rayquaza when disaster imperils this world. The true Lorekeeper of the current generation is the one called Zinnia. The disaster that now approaches our planet, as it has twice before... Zinnia has been trying for some time to avert it... in her own way. To draw Lord Rayquaza to our sphere, she joined a certain organization that sought to revive the super-ancient Pokémon. She taught them the secrets needed to bring back these threats and summon the great Dragon itself. And now it seems she travels the land, scouring the world for Key Stones...
So it was true... As I had suspected, that woman who appeared at the Space Center was one of the Draconids...
But I never dreamed she was involved in the attempted revival of the super-ancient Pokémon... In full knowledge of the power they held, fully understanding the terrible changes they would wreak upon our world... Still she helped bring that situation about? Did she give a thought to the many people and Pokémon whose lives were put at grave risk by her actions? Could she accept the inevitable sacrifice of so many lives, in order to protect the planet from the coming meteoroid?
Balance must rule this world. History is doomed to repeat itself... While our people have overcome many disasters in the past, it was always through great, great sacrifice... Yet we have continued to struggle to preserve peace for as many years as we can. That is how we have protected this world, upon which we now live. People... Pokémon... All nature... And, yes, even you. I do not know exactly what you plan to do. But do you believe that you are not sacrificing anything for your own protection? Zinnia will follow her convictions until the very end. Even knowing the sacrifices that they will require. Even if the sacrificial blade is leveled at her own heart.
... Is that right? ... I understand. Thank you for everything.
What is this... This vague sense of apprehension... And my intuition has often proven true. I am going back to Rustboro first. I have to get back to Devon.
That silver-haired dreamboat said he was headed back to Rustboro.

@s! You came!
@s! You finally made it, huh!
We've got to save Professor Cozmo from these people!
We've gotta protect the professor from these lunatics or else!
There are two of them... And two of us... @s, please! Battle together with me!
There's two of them... And two of us, huh? Sorry to ask, @s, but... Battle alongside me!
What?! Ah! I get it! You've got to get ready first? I'll hold them here, so hurry!!
So even you get nervous, huh... I get it. I'll wait till you get ready.
Thanks a mill!
Thanks, pal!
Ahyahyahya! Isn't this amusing?! Is it really your intention to oppose me, a Team Magma Admin, just the two of you? Mmm... Very well then! I'll show you how terrifying adults can be! Ahyahyahya! I'm going to give you some very thorough coaching!
Ah! So even I, Team Aqua Admin Shelly, have been made a fool. ...Fine! Brats who don't know how to watch their mouths must be punished! I won't forgive you if you cower in fear either! Wahahaha!
This'll be my first time battling beside you, @s! I've got to do my best!
All right! Let's do this!
Hyuhn?! An unexpected development?!
Ahhh?! Did I go too easy on you?!
We did it, @s!
All right! We beat 'em!
You children! I would like you to stay out of my way! Team Magma's scientific prowess, Mt. Chimney's energy... And the hidden power of the Meteorite! If we combine them all, a super-ancient Pokémon...
If the tremendous energy of Mt. Chimney and the Meteorite are combined, we of Team Aqua can take a giant step toward the world that we dream of! We won't let ignorant little brats get in our way!
Hmph... Do these mere children give you so much trouble? You—an Admin of Team Aqua...
Bwahahahahahaha! You lost to this scamp? What a pathetic bunch! You lazy stooges will be the downfall of Team Magma!
Wh-who's there?!
Who's that?!
Hyahya! Even Team Aqua is making an appearance! The odds do not appear to be in my favor...
Hmph! Even Team Magma showed their faces, huh? There's nothing to be done about it...
You there! I'll have the Meteorite now!
Hey! Grab that Meteorite!
Yes, sir!
Aye aye!
Wha-wha-wha-what?!
Come now! Hand over the Meteorite!
Come on! Hand over the Meteorite!
Augh?!
Professor!
Professor!
Ahyahya! The Meteorite is in the palm of my hand! Well, well, well... Adios to each and every one of you! At long last I'm off to Mt. Chimney!
Ahahaha! Later days, brats and Team Magma! All right, time to rush to Mt. Chimney!
Hmph...
Tch!

Maxie... We must give chase to Team Aqua or else...
Archie! We will go after those monsters!
Hmm...
That's right! We're not letting them get away!
... My name is Maxie. I lead an organization known as Team Magma. We work for the future happiness of all mankind. From what I have seen here, it appears that you are working against our rivals in Team Aqua. ...Fine. Amuse yourself with those Team Aqua fools. But be careful you do not impede our goals. Be you child or grown, oppose us in the slightest, and I, the great Maxie, will show no mercy!
Oh? What's this? You've got quite a fierce expression on you for such a wee little thing. The name's Archie. I'm the leader of Team Aqua, a group that's working to return the world to a pristine state. One that'll be perfect for Pokémon's survival. Looks like you were getting into it with Team Magma there, 'less my eyes deceive me. It's not like I'm in a position to argue if that's what you're up to, hey? But I'll tell you this much. So remember. If you next get in the way of Team Aqua, you won't get off so lightly. So steer clear and keep your nose clean, scamp! I imagine I'll be seeing you! Waha! Bwahahahahah!
Oh bother! I have no idea what's going on anymore with all these people!
Oh man... What's with those lunatics?
Never mind those nuts! Professor, you doing OK?!
Forget those guys! Professor! Hey! Professor Cozmo! Hang in there, OK?
B-but...they... I...only...
Looks like he's still pretty out of it...
I think he's still pretty out of it...

Never mind what's happened! I've got to get the professor back to his lab in Fallarbor!

It's over... It's all over...
...Zinnia, my child.
...Grannie.
...You have worked so hard.
...
...It is enough, child. ...Be done with your burden. Let it go now. For everything there must be an ending. Only then... Only then can there be a new beginning. This is immutable truth that all living things on this planet, great and small, must accept. We Draconids have seen it in our history, as you have seen it in your own life.
Now is the time for rest. Let down the great burden you have borne so long alone... So that you might at last take a step forward toward new life. Now is the time for rest...
...
... Yes.
Child, you...
I heard of what happened from Zinnia. The Draconids owe you much. Thank you, child.
Zinnia has gone on a journey. A journey to find herself this time.
Ah, yes... She did leave this for you, though. I hope you will accept it.
I wonder what kind of future Zinnia might find for herself, now that she is free from the fate of the Draconids. Though I don't think that I need worry about it.
Ah, yes. If ever your Rayquaza forgets how to use Dragon Ascent, come call upon me. I may not seem like much, but I am also one of the last Draconids. I can help the Dragon lord remember that grand move.

Rediscover the charm of Pokémon! Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular! Would you like to participate in the contest?
Let's all show off for the judges and have fun! Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular! Here, you can participate in a contest with people nearby.
The Pokémon Contest Spectacular is a fun, spectacular event where four Trainers compete to see who has the loveliest Pokémon! First up is the Introduction Round! It's a competition between Pokémon who have increased their coolness or cuteness with a Pokéblock. After the Introduction Round, it's time for the Talent Round! It's a competition to see who can use their moves the best over the course of five turns! Use moves that match the title of the contest to make the audience go crazy! One last thing, there are two kinds of contests: single player, which you play alone, and multiplayer, which you play with friends. When you keep on winning single-player contests, you can enter higher and higher ranks, like Super Rank and Hyper Rank. Once you can enter a rank in single player, it becomes available in multiplayer! Please give it a try and see if you can become a Contest Star!
Then, please select the Pokémon you wish to enter.
If you'd like to decide the rules, choose “Become a leader,” and if not, choose “Join a group.”
Which category do you want to participate in?
How about rank?
How many people will play?
The contest will be held in a special hall. Please note that the camera's shutter sound will always be played at a fixed volume, regardless of the current volume setting. Do you still want to participate in it?
Your entry was accepted! Your Entry No. is [VAR NUM1(0000)].
Please come again.
Thank you for participating! We hope to see you again soon!
Congratulations, @s! Your [VAR PKNICK(0001)] performed very well. We hope to see you again soon!
Congratulations! In commemoration of the victory of your [VAR PKNICK(0001)] in the Master Rank of the [VAR 01A2(0002)] Contest, I present this Ribbon!
What's more... Since [VAR PKNICK(0000)] won all the Master Ranks... In honor of its glory... I'll give you a Contest Star Ribbon, too! Whoopee! Bravo!
@s, we wish you and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] even greater success! We look forward to seeing you again!
Umm... Please participate in the contest again. Please come back again. I'll be waiting!
Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular! ...Oh? You don't seem to have a Contest Pass. We only accept Trainers who have Contest Passes as contestants of the Pokémon Contest Spectacular! Well, let me see... You might be able to get it from somebody. Slateport City is a big place. Why don't you try sightseeing in different places?
Oh! By the way, someone seems to be waiting for you in the green room. ...Right over there.
You can't participate in that rank yet! Please win the next-lowest rank first.
All right then, it's back to our good old hall.
I'm in charge of preparing the Contest Hall for everyone. If you'd like, I can create a special effect during the Talent Round in the Contest Hall. Do you want me to do it?
All right! I'll get it ready for you. Just enter the contest as usual.
All right! I'll prepare the hall as usual.
Well, how can I explain it? I can project a hologram through the entire hall. You won't be able to see the audience, but I think you'll enjoy the contest in a different atmosphere. The kind of atmosphere it will be is up to you. Well, let me ask you again...

@s has changed into a Contest Costume!
I was watching the contest just now, and it was amazing! I'm so jealous! I wish I could perform like that! I don't even have a Contest Pass, though...
And that's why I want you to give it your all for me, too. Here, take this.
I saw you doin' your thing up there. It looks like contests are all about Pokémon, but the truth is that it's the combination of a Pokémon and its Trainer that matters most. Your Pokémon trusted your instructions about how to appeal to the crowd. I could see the bond between you and your Pokémon.
I wanna see you and your Pokémon performing even better. Let me give you a hand.
I was watching that contest and found it quite impressive indeed. Before I knew it, I was spellbound. Thank you for a lovely time.
I'm looking forward to your next performance. Take this as a symbol of my hopes for you.
I was fortunate enough to be able to view the contest in which you just partook. As a spectator of the contest, I am confident of my taste and discernment. It is my considered opinion that your performance was dazzling!
I expect more excellence from you in the future! Also, please be so kind as to wear that costume next time!
That contest was totally awesome! The Pokémon came out all “Boom!” Then the crowd was all, like, “Whoa!” It made me question my whole existence as a Picnicker. I'm a little distraught... That was fun, though!
I found this in the mountains. You can have it!
Good job! Your Pokémon is so lovely! I do hope you'll tell me sometime what you've done to raise your Pokémon so well.
I'll give you this. ...OK?
Good gracious, what a contest! Your performance made the whole thing! I came down here from the mountains in the hope I could find something good. Thanks for making my day!
Oh yeah! Let me give you something I found up in the mountains.
Hohoho! That was quite a nice contest just now. You and your Pokémon were so dreadfully charming that I simply couldn't take my eyes off you.
I have nothing but this to offer you, but would you be so gracious as to accept it?
You and your Pokémon... It would appear that you possess some mysterious power. I found myself fascinated by it in spite of myself. There must be something to this power!
I will bestow this upon you. Strive to further amplify your power!
You've got a nice team, don't you? I was touched! Even adults want to feel the excitement of Pokémon. Thanks for making it such a nice contest for us!
This is a reward from me.
That contest was excellent! When I see Pokémon giving their all to impress the crowd like that, it makes me feel alive!
Of course I saw how hard you were trying, too.
I've been waiting for you! What an amazing performance! I really wanted to tell you that. Please let me see your Pokémon again sometime.
I'll give you this, then. It's a deal, OK?
You're wonderful! I was moved! I felt the potential of Pokémon for things other than battles.
This is for your Pokémon, so they may shine even more brightly!
Hey! Hey, you! You were just in that contest, weren't you? Let's see, how can I put this... It was pretty good, wasn't it? I thought you and your [VAR PKNICK(0000)] were great.
You can have this. Show me something great again next time!
I saw that contest that you and your Pokémon performed in. There are some delightful attractions over here in the Hoenn region, too.
Oh yeah! As long as you're here, take this. It's fine! It's fine! Put this present to good use.
This is a portrait of [VAR PKNICK(0001)], who performed well in the [VAR 01A2(0000)] Contest!
It looks like a place to display a portrait of a Pokémon that performed well in a contest.
It's a photo taken during the contest!
This looks like the place where a contest photo can be displayed.
Which would you like to know about?
Contests
Conditions
Pokéblocks
Pokéblock Kits
Condition refers to how well a Pokémon is displaying the charms it possesses. You can raise a Pokémon's condition by feeding it Pokéblocks. As long as you have Berries and a Pokéblock Kit, you can make Pokéblocks at any time. Pokémon that have a high condition that matches the contest's title will get bonus points in the Introduction Round. Be sure to raise the condition of whichever contest you'd like to make a splash in!
A Pokéblock is a lovely snack that you can use to raise your Pokémon's condition. You can make them by mixing together between two to four Berries. What kind of Pokéblock you make depends on the kinds of Berries you use, and different blocks raise different conditions. By the way, there are supposedly Pokéblocks made from very rare Berries, which greatly raise a Pokémon's condition! Please try out many different combinations!
A Pokéblock Kit is a convenient tool that lets you make Pokéblocks and feed them to your Pokémon. You can use a machine called a Berry Blender to make Pokéblocks. You can organize Pokéblocks by what kind they are and store them in your Pokéblock Case. It's very convenient!
Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular! It looks like you've brought your Contest Pass. Keep on trying until you become a contest star! Before we begin, some advice for first-timers... During the contest, your Pokémon will show the audience just how lovely it is! First up is the Introduction Round! The appearance of Pokémon that have raised their Coolness, Cuteness, or other conditions with Pokéblocks will be judged. After the Introduction Round, it's time for the Talent Round! It's a competition to determine how well Pokémon can use their moves over the course of five turns. Use moves that match the condition of the contest to make the audience go crazy! If you check the moves of the Pokémon that you want to put in the contest, you can see that they're split into five different conditions, such as Coolness and Cuteness. If you're in a contest with the same title as that condition, you can use that move to appeal to the crowd! After you place first in a Normal Rank contest, you can win your way through higher ranks! Very well...
Right this way, please!
Congratulations! @s's Pokémon performed the best! Next time, you can enter your Pokémon in the [VAR 01A4(0003)] of the [VAR 01A2(0002)] Contest!
Please be sure to enter the next rank, too! We'll be waiting for you!
Wireless communication is currently disabled. Please turn wireless communication on.
Please wait until preparations are complete.

Yaaay! Finally, we all got to appear together!
@s! Let me introduce you! This is my uncle, Wallace. Uncle Wallace, this is the [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl I was telling you about!
@s! Let me introduce you! This is my uncle, Wallace. Uncle Wallace, this is the [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl I was telling you about!
No introductions necessary, Lisia. I would say that @s and I... know each other quite well already.
Huh? You do? Oh! I get it! You ARE a Gym Leader after all, Uncle Wallace. So you guys battled before?
They defeated me when we battled. And if that were not enough, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she is also a great Trainer who carried out splendid deeds for Hoenn. That is who @s is.
You appear to be well. Lisia has been so enraptured by the contest spectacles that I felt compelled to see them for myself. It has been many years since I last took part in the likes of a contest... And here I find you once more.
It is not only in my own Gym that you have defeated me, but you have bested me in contests as well. It seems I still have much to learn...
Did you know... It was I who first instructed Lisia in the ways of Pokémon contests. Somewhere along the way, it appears my little niece has surpassed her teacher. It seems I still have much to learn...
I managed to seize victory from you and Lisia today, but it was no easy thing. It seems there is still more for me to learn...
I certainly failed to show off my abilities today. Perhaps I've been away too many years...
Never mind, Uncle Wall! We had fun and that's what matters!
I suppose you're right.
@s, I'm sure you've grown to understand this already. No matter whether you stand in a Pokémon Gym or Contest Hall, a Trainer who holds to h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser belief in the Pokémon beside h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer... The Pokémon that battles on, believing in the Trainer with whom it stands together... The settings may differ, but their labors come to fruition in a way that honors their bond! There is equal beauty in both!
That's a lovely thought, Uncle Wall. Really wonderful!
Yes... And confoundingly elegant!
And so very, very...
...Glorious!
You two have shown yourselves to be fine Trainers, with bright futures ahead of you.
What is it?
Tell me about Lisia.
So you did contests?
Nothing, really...
Lisia is the daughter of my elder sister and does not live in Sootopolis any longer. She was tucked safely away during that infamous incident, so she would probably be quite shocked to learn your part in it.
Yes, I once tried my hand at contests. But Lisia has a natural talent for them that greatly surpasses mine. She became an idol almost overnight. As a result, I was able to apply myself fully to my role as Gym Leader. After this, I almost feel as though I should give contests another try. Or perhaps I should steal the title of Pokémon League Champion from you. That could be quite amusing...
I imagine Steven must be gnashing his teeth over missing today's Contest Spectacular.
'Sup?
Tell me more about Wallace.
So about these contests...
Nothing, really...
Oh, yeah, you battled Uncle Wall, right? Is he really as strong as they say? All his friends seem to be super-strong Trainers, too. Like that one guy obsessed with stones, or that Trainer who looks like a star... Hmm. And you still beat him. I guess that means that... You really are amazing, @s!

Yeah, it was because I saw my uncle doing contests that I decided to try, too. He's my mentor. He taught me all about competing in contests! And Uncle Wall has a mentor of his own, named Juan... I wonder if someone will ever look up to me as a mentor. Who knows?
Today's contest sure was fun!

Tee hee... I lost!
@s, you and your Pokémon have already gone beyond our reach. You were totally amazing out there. And you've got tons of fans, too! You're a force to be reckoned with!

I said the other day that I wondered what made you so special... I think I've got a better idea now what it is.
I said the other day that I wondered what made you so special... I think I've got a better idea now what it is.
See... It's probably 'cause you don't do just contests, @s... You're out there filling your Pokédex, taking on Pokémon Gyms, and all kinds of other things! You and your Pokémon shared all those experiences... That's why you can show off the real appeal of your Pokémon better than any one of us can!

I've started thinking that I should do the same, Gyms and Pokédex and all.
My, my, my. If that's the case, then I'll be your rival in each of those as well!
Oh, Chaz! Did you come to say congratulations, too?
Would I do that? I still don't see that this little squirt has anything special in the way of skills. Humph! I might beat you myself one of these days, Lisia. And then I'd be just as good! The only reason I'm here is to tell this upstart to watch out, because I'm next! Macherie, would you open the box?
Hee hee hee! Truth is you're happy [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she won, huh? But if you really want to beat me...
Then that means I have to beat all the Master Rank contests. I know. I've decided to put Macherie in the Toughness Contest. Macherie is cute, and even if she gets tougher, she'll always be cute! She's my adorable Macherie, after all!
Machi!
It seems like she wants to try it out. When I watched @s winning contest after contest like that, I realized it was time to let go of my stupid hang-ups.
Chaz, that's...
Anyway! Since we've decided to go for it, me and Macherie are going all out in toughness training from now on! We'll challenge Gyms and do whatever it takes! We're headed for some strength training right after this, in fact...
Hey, Chaz. It's workout time!
Yo! Yessir! We'll be right there, Brawly, sir!
Oh, it's you? I didn't know you knew Chaz.
I've never watched a contest before, but if you and Chaz are in it, I should watch at least one contest! OK, Chaz, let's go!
Yessir!
Maaachi!
“I'm going to go get tougher, and then I'll come back—so please wait for me, Ali! I've been acting like a fool... I thought just being near you was all I needed to be happy, but... We're each other's best rivals, right? So let's put everything into it! Hee hee!” ...Th-that's what Macherie said, that sweet girl of mine!
Alalala...
“Yes! Give it your all! Don't stop till you drop!” That's what Ali wants to say. Right, Ali?
Aliii?!
You two understand what Pokémon are saying? That's incredible! OK. Now we're really leaving!
That Chaz... He's a pretty good guy after all.
Now it's time you let me give you a little something, too! This marks the final chapter in the brilliant story of @s!
Now it's time you let me give you a little something, too! This marks the final chapter in the brilliant story of @s!

Here, use this to brighten up your life! It's a special gift for a fantastic contest star!
I'm so glad that you're the one I scouted that day, @s! I'm so glad I'm a contest idol! I really hope you're as happy as I am about making it this far.

Impressive contest skills... Equally impressive battle skills... @s, I've gotta tell my uncle about making friends with a star like you! He's great at contests and battling, too! You've gotta meet him, @s!

You know, I've scouted a lot of Trainers for contests. Of course, they've all been great! But... But, @s! You're really something special! It's not just 'cause you're the 100th person I scouted, either... It's like... It's like you've got something no one else has.

The next time you take part in a Master Rank contest, @s... Ali and I will take part, too! We... We won't lose to you! I've been doing my best as a contest idol for a long time, together with Ali. And I'm gonna use everything I've got against you, @s!

If you and I appear in a Contest Spectacular together, the fans will love it. Most important, it will be really, really, really fun!
No holding back! Let's both give it our all!
Hm? You want something?
Where were you?
What about your idol job?
No, it's fine.
You wanna know where I've been? Well, duh! I've been getting ready so I could stand on stage with you! Tee hee! Ali and I did a ton of special training so we'd be ready to shine!

It's me, Chaz the a-a-a-a-awesome! Heh! No Lisia today—too bad for you! But try not to look so disappointed. Sheesh.
Mamach! Machee?
Guess it's too bad for you, too, Macherie. You missed your chance to see Ali, huh?
Lisia's spending all her time practicing moves with Ali lately. She's waiting for you to win all the Master Rank contests. For you to become a real contest star... She says she wants to become better than ever so she can do her best performance together with you. That's why she's trying so hard. She's practically never here anymore.
She looks like she's having a lot of fun when she's practicing, though. I guess she wants to show you something that'll knock your socks off. Honestly... I really wanted it to be me.
But... If you can't win all Master Rank contests, you'll never be able to stand toe-to-toe with Lisia... But you already know that, huh? M-me, I'll never be able to stand toe-to-toe with her.
Maaah...
Cheer up, Macherie. You're my sweet and adorable girl! And that's why I'll never, ever make you do a Toughness Contest! I can't make a cutie like you try to increase your Toughness! No way!
I'm still the best rival for Lisia. I'm not wrong about that. But it doesn't mean that...well... that you haven't got a part to play, too. So, um...you know... Just take this and give it your all. Macherie, could you open the box?
Lisia's not the type to care about beating somebody else or whatever... The point is that the contest lets you show off how fantastic your Pokémon are... Guess I'm saying...well...I'm behind you, too.
Cham cham!

I don't think anyone would say I've been “pining”... And could you have picked a worse time to interrupt?

Oh, Macherie? Well, Chaz says they met on a dark and rainy night. Macherie was a Machop back then, and someone had just left her there in a box... That's the box that she always carries around with her, you see? I guess it's her fond memento of the moment she and Chaz first met.
Yeah? I'm glad we get the chance to chat after contests, though.
Humph. Well, if you're going to keep going in the contest world, you'd better do your best on stage so you don't embarrass Lisia. She did scout you, after all!
Maaachan! (Macherie seems to be very happy...)
Teep!

Looks like we've reached the next chapter in your story! I'm calling it...
“Is This a Dream? Am I a Future Contest Star?”
Ahhhh, it's so marvelous! I'm sure you're on the path to contest stardom! You'll be a star, @s!
Ahhhh, it's so marvelous! I'm sure you're on the path to contest stardom! You'll be a star, @s!
Thanks!
I don't think so...
Of course! There's something captivating about your performance on stage. I bet you'll have an army of fans in no time! Watch out!

Hmph! Good luck waiting for me to be your fan!
Chaz!
Who is this supposed to be, Lisia? I'm meant to be your one and only rival!
Now look here. Maybe you don't know this, but me and Lisia are the most famous rivals in the contest world! When we debuted together back in Lilycove, we stood at the top of the lighthouse and swore that we would both do our best to win! We talked the whole night, till dawn! Well, actually, we talked for about 40 minutes, but it was still amazing!
Come on, Chaz! How many times do I have to tell you that there are no rivals in contests? It's not that kind of a competition! It's the combination of the Trainer and his or her Pokémon that—
What's wrong with being rivals? It makes it more fun for the people watching us. Don't try to deny it! When people think of you, they think of me. And the other way around!
When they think of me, they should think of Ali...
Well, that's just the way things are. You get it now, newbie? Sorry that you got your hopes up and all, but Lisia's real rival will always be ME. There's no room for you in our dramatic story of success and glory!
Oh, that Chaz! He never listens! Don't mind him, @s. I'm not interested in rivals or stuff like that. I just want everyone to have fun together and enjoy Contest Spectaculars!
Oh, that Chaz! He never listens! Don't mind him, @s. I'm not interested in rivals or stuff like that. I just want everyone to have fun together and enjoy Contest Spectaculars!
Yeah? What is it, @s?
Yeah? What is it, @s?
Tell me about Ali.
So about Chaz...
Nothing, really.
Some people say that “Ali” sounds like a girl's name, but my Ali is definitely a boy! I always think Ali's the cutest, but there's more to him than that. When it comes to contests, Ali really shines! We've been doing our best together ever since he was a Swablu. I hope we'll be partners forever!
About Chaz... He's a Trainer who made his debut in the contest world the same day I did. He's definitely a bit, um, unique... But he works really hard at what he does.
Then I guess I'll look forward to your next performance!
Alilili!

“I Won't Give Up! The First Tears Fall...”
Tee hee. Don't feel too bad. This is an important step everyone has to take to become a star!
Hmm, lemme think... It'd probably be easier for you to win if you gave your Pokémon more Pokéblocks! Pokéblocks are pretty important, since they let you raise your Pokémon's conditions! Even if your moves aren't quite up to snuff, you might still be able to squeak through in a contest with good-enough conditions! Here, try making a Pokéblock from this, and give it to your Pokémon for me, OK?
But it is @s we're talking about. I'm sure you can win next time! Don't give up!

Why do you do contests?
Nothing, really.
What? A battle? Oooh... Truth is, I'm not all that hot at battles... But don't you worry! Maybe I'll get to take you on in a contest someday!
I started in contests because I wanted to show people that there's this whole other amazing side to Pokémon, more than what you see in battles or whatever. Pokémon are about more than strength. You can raise 'em to be beautiful, or you can raise 'em to be tough as nails. They grow and change, trying as hard as they can to live up to their Trainer's feelings.
Ali! Altari!
I want the whole world to get it about all the other cool aspects of raising Pokémon! That's why Ali and I set out to become stars! When you're a star, and everyone starts following you, then they naturally start wanting to know more about contests, too. Am I right?
See, that's why I started thinking that a Trainer shouldn't just depend on Pokémon. The Trainer's gotta be just as cute, or just as cool, to stand alongside their awesome Pokémon!
Oopsies! Sorry again! I probably went on too much...
You gotta win again next time, OK?
Liii?

It's very, very, very fashionable, and any costume looks fantastic on the Pikachu! You'll really, really, really stand out if you two go on stage with matching costumes!

Uh... Your Box is full... I'll let you have the Pikachu next time! See you!
Oh! You came here to get the fashion-conscious Cosplay Pikachu. Go on stage with matching costumes!
Take good care of that Pikachu!

Welcome, @s.
Welcome, @s.
I was hoping I would get to see you make it here one day.
Tell me... What have you seen on your journey with your Pokémon?
What have you felt, meeting so many other Trainers out there?
Traveling this rich land of Hoenn... Has it awoken something inside you? I want you to come at me with all that you've learned. My Pokémon and I will respond in turn with all that we know!
Let it begin!
[~ 7]
Just as I have come to expect. @s, you are truly an excellent Pokémon Trainer. Congratulations to you!
And thank you... I had wanted to learn how you feel about this world, what kinds of ideals you have developed with your Pokémon... I feel I was able to find the answer in our battle.
The feelings you have for your Pokémon... And the way that your Pokémon gave their all in battle in response to those feelings...
Those two together created a great power. That is how you seized victory today.
I felt a thrill of excitement in my breast when we first met, and now I know for sure that feeling was not misplaced! You are rightfully the Hoenn region's new...
@s, wait! I've got some advice you've got to hear before you challenge the Champion...
Huh? Wait—what? What? @s... Could it be that... It's already over?
@s! Before you go to challenge the Champion, I've got one last thing you've got to...
@s... You didn't... No, you couldn't have... Did you already beat the Champion?!
See? What did I say, May? Didn't I tell you that @s would be just fine?
See? What did I say, Brendan? Didn't I tell you that @s would be just fine?
@s, you've finally done it. When I heard that you defeated your own father at the Petalburg Gym, I thought perhaps you had a chance... But to think you've actually become the Champion!
@s, you've finally done it. When I heard that you defeated your own father at the Petalburg Gym, I thought perhaps you had a chance... But to think you've actually become the Champion!
[~ 21]
But congratulations on today's victory! Now go in there with your head held high!
@s... No, I should call you the Hoenn region's new Pokémon League Champion... Come with me, Champion.
@s... No, I should call you the Hoenn region's new Pokémon League Champion... Come with me, Champion.
I'm very sorry...
But only a Trainer who has successfully become the Champion may go beyond this point. You'll need to wait outside with the professor.
No waaay!
...
Just joking! It's OK! It's fine! Rules are rules, right?
@s! Honestly, congratulations!
Wha—
...
Can't be helped, I guess. Them's the rules, right?
That's awesome, @s. Congratulations...really!
Welcome back, @s.
Welcome back, @s.
I just thought, you know, that since we were both here and all...that I'd wait for you.
I just, uh, you know...
We set out on this journey together, right? So maybe we should finish it together, too.
We set out on this journey together, right? So maybe we should finish it together, too.
Hee hee...
D-don't go trying to read anything into it, though!
So...come on! Let's go home! Back to Littleroot Town!
Now, come on! We're going home! Back to Littleroot Town!
I still owe you for your help at the Sky Pillar. Thank you for that.
Hahaha! How unlike you to be so thoughtful.
Heh... You know, this experience really brought it home for me again... That there is still so much about this world that I do not know.
I wonder what would have happened to Hoenn... If @s had not been here to aid us with this, and the incident with the super-ancient Pokémon... I alone was powerless to stop either.
I wonder what would have happened to Hoenn... If @s had not been here to aid us with this, and the incident with the super-ancient Pokémon... I alone was powerless to stop either.
There is no one person in this world who knows all. None who can do all. Steven... There is no cause for such worries or concern.
Hmm. Heh. Don't worry. It's not that I am so shocked by my own disappointing performance. But rather...
Rather what?
I was just thinking how much more there is I must learn about nature...about Pokémon... and about my fellow humans as well... If I am to keep living in this huge, wide world.
I want to walk this world on my own two feet. To see it with my own eyes. To feel it on my very skin...
I need to put into practice all of the advice I ever gave to @s. That's what I am thinking now.
I need to put into practice all of the advice I ever gave to @s. That's what I am thinking now.
...? Steven... You can't intend to...
Hah hah hah! But no need to fear... I won't just disappear at once. I'll still be around doing my duty on behalf of the Pokémon League.
But, hmm... When the time does come for me to pursue my own hopes...
Well... I hope that you, Wallace, will be behind me to lend a hand.
...
Hmph. It seems I have little choice. I bow to the whims of the pampered heir. I, Wallace, will do this thing you wish.
Heh.
Hah hah hah... Thank you, my friend...
Now then... There are no words left for us to exchange. We will understand one another through battle!
I knew you would be strong... But I don't regret our battle. Because each time that I battle you, I learn more about Pokémon... Yes... I have something I'd like to give to you in thanks for all you've done.
That is a very special piece from my collection... But I think you are capable of appreciating its worth.
Come. It is time we record your great victory.
Welcome, Champion. Let me test my skills against you once again!
In the end, you are still the strongest. Amazing. Now let us make a record of your victory!
Just as I have come to expect. @s, you are truly an excellent Pokémon Trainer. Congratulations to you!

I am the last of the Pokémon League Elite Four, Drake the Dragon master!
In their natural state, Pokémon are wild living things. They are free. At times, they hinder us. At times, they help us.
For us to battle alongside Pokémon as partners, do you know what it takes? Do you know what is needed?
If you don't, you will never prevail over me!
[~ 4]
You deserve every credit for coming this far as a Pokémon Trainer. You do seem to know what is needed.
Yes, what a Trainer needs is a true and virtuous heart. It is through their contact with Trainers that Pokémon learn right from wrong. The influence of their Trainers' good hearts helps them grow strong!
Go! Go onward! The Champion is waiting!
Oh, I've been waitin' for you! My Pokémon and I are going to show you everything we've got! Well then, you had better get ready to try and stop me!
I got a glimpse inside your heart! There's nothing for me to say to you! Go forth, Trainer! Go on to your next challenge with your head held high!

Welcome. My name is Glacia of the Elite Four. I've traveled from afar to Hoenn so that I may hone my Ice-type moves.
But all I have seen are challenges by weak Trainers and their Pokémon.
I wonder what you will show me.
What a relief it would be if I could, for once, have a serious battle against an opponent!
[~ 4]
You and your Pokémon... How fiercely your spirits burn! My icy moves pale in the face of such all-consuming flames.
Advance to the next room. There you will learn how fearsome the Pokémon League can truly be!
I've been waiting for a Trainer with a burning-hot soul. How can you oppose Mega Evolution that can freeze everything?
Hmmph... Do you intend to thaw my very heart? That actually wouldn't bother me. Anyway, continue onward! Drake is waiting for you as well.

I'm Phoebe of the Elite Four.
I did my training on Mt. Pyre. While I trained there, I gained the ability to commune with Ghost-type Pokémon.

Come on! Just try and see if you can even inflict damage on my Pokémon!
[~ 5]
There's definitely a bond between you and your Pokémon, too. I didn't recognize that fact, so it's only natural that I lost.
Yup, I'd like to see how far your bond will carry you.
Go ahead. Move on to the next room.
Ahaha! I've been waiting for you! I'm bringing a little something new to the table this time! Prepare yourself and bring it on!
Hmmp, what a shame. I lost again, huh? But on the bright side... We fought together, so the bonds between my Pokémon and me got even deeper! I look forward to being able to battle you again sometime!

[~ 3]
Well, listen to what this loser has to say. You've got what it takes to go a long way!
Go on to the next room and challenge your next battle!
Yo! I've been waiting for you, Champion! With the strength you've gained, we can battle with no holds barred! Not to mention, our boy Steven sent us Elite Four some Key Stones! In other words, my Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too... Heh heh... This one's gonna be fun!
I was waiting for you, Champion. No matter who wins, no hard feelings! Let's get our most excellent battle underway!
Heh... I knew you really were the strongest... Well, hurry up and get out of here! Everybody else is still waiting for you!

Aha! Pokémon Journal If you use Trick Room after Trick Room is used, the Pokémon with the higher Speed stat can attack first again.
The Victory Road is the place where many strong Trainers gather from all over the world. They use Pokémon from other regions as well as from Hoenn, so we can't let our guard down even for a second!

Ever Grande City The paradise of flowers, the sea, and Pokémon.
I don't believe it! A Surf pro like me can't climb a waterfall?!
The HM move Waterfall... Rumor has it that you can't use it unless you defeat the Sootopolis City Gym Leader, Wallace. Rumor? True fact!

Do you know the Pokémon Shroomish? It's hardly ever seen in Sootopolis. Anyway, I love to play with my Shroomish in Pokémon-Amie! My younger brother says Barboach is cuter. That's silly. Shroomish is cuter. There's no doubt about it. Huh? Do you have a Shroomish? P-p-please, show it to me!
Oh, now this is quite something... Hold on! This is not a Shroomish!
It's a Barboach! You're so mean!
You don't have a Shroomish? That's too bad... Please show me your affectionate Shroomish next time.
Oh, Shroomish! Hmmm... But my Shroomish is more affectionate and cuter than yours.
Wow! This Shroomish is so cute! And your Shroomish is very affectionate toward you, too!
Hm. Hmmm... This Shroomish is certainly cute... I hate to admit it, but it looks as affectionate as my Barboach, too.
Thank you for showing it to us. As a token of thanks, please take this!
Ah... Pokémon-Amie is the best! Shroomish is the best!
Ah... Pokémon-Amie is the best! Shroomish is the best! Barboach is pretty good, too!
Do you know the Pokémon Barboach? It's rarely seen in Sootopolis. I love to play with my Barboach in Pokémon-Amie. My big brother says Shroomish is cuter. But that's wrong. Everybody knows Barboach is cuter! Hunh? Do you have a Barboach? P-p-please show it to me!
Oh, now this is quite something... No! This is not a Barboach!
It's a Shroomish! You're terrible!
Don't you have a Barboach? How disappointing... Please show me your affectionate Barboach next time!
Wow, Barboach! Hmmm... But my Barboach is more affectionate and cuter than yours.
Wow! This Barboach is so cute! And your Barboach is very affectionate toward you, too!
Hm. Hmm... This Barboach is surely cute... I hate to admit it, but it looks as affectionate as my Shroomish.
Thank you for showing it to me. I'll give you this as a token of my appreciation!
Ah... Pokémon-Amie is the best! Barboach is the best!

This crater was created when a huge meteoroid crashed into the earth here... Over time, the crater filled with rainwater, and that is how the city of Sootopolis came to be.
This narrow cave is all that links Sootopolis to the outside world. It's almost as though this place was made to keep something from getting out... Or am I just imagining things?

There appears to be some connection between Sootopolis and Mt. Pyre. My friends and I did some research on it at the lab where I used to work.
My big brother used to study the sea.

Listen up, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl, and I'll share something worth hearing. People say there's an ancient ruin in the sea around here. There could be lost treasure waiting to be discovered!
Yes, ancient treasure... It would be cool if it existed! But even if there's no treasure to be found, going on an underwater stroll with my Pokémon is cool in itself!
Ma?! Mawrrr?!

You're a Pokémon Trainer, aren't you? Sootopolis's Gym Leader, Wallace, has a lot of fans. Do you have any fans?
Ohhh... Then you must be pretty strong.
Oh dear... That's kinda sad. Put a little work into getting your own fan following!
Dedicated fans flock in, even from as far away as the Kanto and Johto regions. He must be the coolest Water-type Gym Leader in the world!

Mt. Pyre... People believe there are two orbs at its peak. Do you know about them?
I see... Legend has it that one brings out some power, and the other one suppresses it.
I see... Legend has it that the two orbs have been deeply connected to all nature, people, and Pokémon since ancient times.

Wallace, this city's Gym Leader, is a powerful Trainer. The best in the whole Hoenn region, people say. But the Elite Four and the Champion are said to be even stronger! How strong could they be?
The whole town has taken refuge, and nobody will leave their home. This weather... Could it be the prelude to something? People were mentioning an old legend or something...
Whenever, wherever, and whatever happens, I will always be friends with my Pokémon. Because it's fun to be with Pokémon!
I don't know why... But...I'm really scared... Mmn. I think I'll watch some BuzzNav and calm myself down...

Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be @s?
Sootopolis's Gym Leader Wallace is a master of Water-type Pokémon. As you make your way to Wallace, the icy floor will hamper your progress.
Just between you and me... Walk on each floor panel just once. That's the trick! Be careful, and go for it!
Yow! You've beaten Wallace, who was supposedly the best in all of Hoenn! OK! Check out your Trainer Card. If you've gotten all the Badges, you're set for the Pokémon League challenge!

Allow me to formally introduce myself.
I am Wallace. The Gym Leader of Sootopolis City.
There's something about you... A difference in your demeanor...
I think I sense that in you.
What happened inside the Cave of Origin, and what you did there... Our upcoming battle will make that all clear.
Now, show me. Show me the power you wield with your Pokémon.
And I, in turn, shall present you...
with a performance of illusions in water...
by me and my Pokémon!
[~ 37]
I realize now your authenticity and magnificence as a Pokémon Trainer.
I find much joy in having met you and your Pokémon.
You have proven yourself worthy of the Rain Badge.
Accept it.
@s received the Rain Badge from Wallace.
Having that Badge assures you full obedience of all your Pokémon to every command you make.
And so you never forget the battle we shared...
Here...
The HM I have given you contains Waterfall. It allows you to smash into an opponent with the force required to climb a waterfall itself. Yes, it is a mighty move... And yet it also has a certain elegance and can sometimes cause opponents to flinch.
Now, with the power of the Rain Badge, you will become able to use this HM move, Waterfall, to scale walls of cascading water.
Many paths are open to you now.
One path would take you to the Pokémon League. It is the goal that all Trainers in Hoenn aspire to reach after obtaining all eight Gym Badges. If that is the path you chose, then you must find your way to the island said to be the most remote in Hoenn: Ever Grande.
But if it is a different path you seek, and you would rather pursue Pokémon and a completed Pokédex... The rumors that reach me on the wind whisper that Professor Birch in Littleroot has created a more powerful Pokédex. Visit him, obtain this new technology, and I have little doubt you will encounter more diverse Pokémon than ever before. ...I will hope that a bright future waits for you, whatever path it is you choose.

Do you know Full Restore? Full restoration of Pokémon's HP! Eradication of all status conditions! It's truly an item of your dreams!
It seems like this extreme weather is not just affecting Sootopolis, but Lilycove and Mossdeep, too. Have we awoken some terrible power, to cause all this mayhem?

You there! You call yourself a fan? Then answer this! Who is the cutest idol in the world?
Whaaat?! Are you mad? What a hopeless fool!
What! How dare you sound so unsure! And no true fan calls her by her real name! You have to call her by her nickname: Lissi! But at least you answered the question right. I'll offer you this as a reward for being able to see the true attractiveness of our lovely Lissi!
I've been to every one of her shows since her debut! I've sent her more than 1,000 fan letters! I came all the way here on a pilgrimage, because I've heard that Lissi has some connection to this town! I am prepared to watch over her until I die! No, even after I die. I'll never stop watching her!
Ahh. I wonder if Lissi's OK.
Maybe Lisia?

Who might you be?
This is the Cave of Origin. The spirits of Pokémon, becalmed at Mt. Pyre, are said to be revived here.
Please leave.
...
Team Magma...and Team Aqua...
We've been waiting, ya scamp!
Leader Maxie... to that child...?
...I know what must be done.
I will entrust this to you now. It is the fruit of our collaboration with the Devon Corporation, and it represents the height of Hoenn's technological knowledge and skill.
We had actually been preparing that in anticipation of making contact with Groudon... But at this point, it doesn't look like there's any hope of that for us... There's nothing we can do except leave it to you.
And yet... Even with that Magma Suit, is it probable that anyone could pass through that magma, now fiercer than ever due to the forces of nature?
That's true. It is very possible that its energy could be far greater than our calculations show.
There is nothing to fear.
The Blue Orb he bears... Its ancient powers will protect both the boy and his Pokémon.
The Blue Orb she bears... Its ancient powers will protect both the girl and her Pokémon.
You've hit the nail on the head! Those old folks at Mt. Pyre did say something about that... That the Red Orb would unleash Groudon's primal powers... And trigger a Primal Reversion. ...While the Blue Orb had the power to reverse that and calm the beast.
Yes. The energy overflowing from the Cave of Origin just now... It is the same energy that gives Groudon its power... With the Blue Orb, which contains the power to suppress that... It should be possible to calm the rage of this flood of magma.
Of course the Blue Orb's power alone will not lead you to where Groudon waits. You will not reach Hoenn's Core that way.
@s... To think that you had the Blue Orb...
@s... To think that you had the Blue Orb...
You'll be OK. You and your Pokémon can handle it, whatever happens.
I believe that.
No man or woman from Sootopolis is permitted to enter the Cave of Origin.
But you must go, together with your Blue Orb.
You must go regardless of what waits for you inside that cave...
We'll also get our people together up top here, to help any folks and Pokémon in trouble.
Child, you... No. I have no right to call you “child.” Fellow Trainer. I have caused great harm, and for that I apologize most sincerely. But now we find ourselves at an impasse, and you and your Pokémon are all that humanity has to count on in its stand against Groudon...
@s!
@s!
I heard on the news that things were going haywire around Sootopolis... And then I saw you on BuzzNav, @s! I couldn't sit there and do nothing when I knew you were here in the thick of it, so I came flying!
When I saw the news about Sootopolis on BuzzNav, and there you were, @s... Anyway, all I could think of was coming to help! You don't know how glad I am to see that you're still in one piece.
Bwuh? Isn't that Team Magma? And Team Aqua?! ...OK, can I just say that I am, like, shocked and confused on so many levels right now?
Bwuh? Is that Team Magma? And Team Aqua?! ...OK, I don't really know what to say right now, but I'm kind of dumbfounded.
This is probably something way bigger than I can imagine, isn't it? So I'm not even going to ask right now.
Look, I get that this is probably something way bigger than I've ever imagined... So I won't bother with any questions now.
I'm going to try to find what I can do to help, and then I'm going to do my best with that. And I'm going to keep on hoping and believing that y-you'll be OK out there, @s.
I'm gonna find out what I should do to help, and then I'm going to do whatever I can. You'd better do the same, @s.
You alone must go. You and your Blue Orb. You must go regardless of what may wait for you inside that cave.
You'll be OK. You and your Pokémon can handle it, whatever happens. I believe that.
We'll also get our people together up top here, to help any folks and Pokémon in trouble. My little scamp of a savior... Looks like we're dumping the whole burden on your wee shoulders. Sorry it has to be that way. But I know you're gonna see this to the end!
Fellow Trainer. I have caused great harm, and for that I apologize most sincerely. But now we find ourselves at an impasse. You and your Pokémon are all that humanity has to count on in its stand against Groudon... The fate of our world... The world upon which all humanity thrives... The fate of our world rests in your hands!
All right! Now is the time for us to carve out a new future with our scientific prowess! For the pride of Team Magma, we will struggle ferociously!
I'm going to try to find what I can do to help, and then I'm going to do my best with that. And I'm going to keep on hoping and believing that you'll be OK out there, @s. Please...give it everything you've got!
I'm gonna find out what I should do to help, and then I'm going to do whatever I can. You'd better go do the same, @s. ...And I'll always be right there behind you. A-after all, we're friends, right?
@s!!!
@s!
It's really over, isn't it...
So it's all over...
@s, we owe you great thanks.
@s, we owe you great thanks.
Look above you. The sky over Sootopolis has returned to normal.
Somehow, it's...so warm...
Is the energy that had been amassed deep within the Cave of Origin now flowing out to pour over the greater world?
It's as if the uncertainty and fear from moments ago never even existed. My heart feels like it's been softly set at ease...
... The sea or the land... Pokémon or humanity... All this time we've just been trying to grab onto happiness for one of them, even if it meant destroying the other...
... I suppose...you may be right...
However... Personally, in my case...
Some wrongs cannot be atoned for, no matter how you try to right them. And I have committed wrongs so great as to bring the whole world to its knees. It may be that I... It may be too much to assume that I should deserve the chance to start anything over.
Leader... Without a doubt, you have committed an offense that can never be forgiven. You have wronged not only Team Magma but all living things on this planet, whether great or small.
However, that is precisely why you must now set things right. You must continue to atone for the sins you have committed, even at the risk of your own life...
T-Tabitha...
... Thank you.
Y'know... Someday we adults are gonna have to hand this world off to this little scamp and the rest of h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser generation. But what kinda world are we adults gonna make? What kinda world do we wanna pass to these kids? If we haven't even figured that out ourselves, we're never gonna get anywhere. So are we gonna make a world where everyone can coexist together? Or, after all, is it gonna be a world that we claim by force? One that we fight and scrabble over... I don't know, but I think we can at least start by giving it some time and thinking it over. All of us can do that, whether we're Team Aqua or Team Magma or whatever...
You were able to use that Blue Orb to great effect, so I imagine you will also be able to handle this. Have Groudon hold it, and you should be able to control its Primal Reversion for at least a short period, such as during a battle.
And that's it from me! Later, scamp!
Farewell.
... Team Magma and Team Aqua are made up of people with completely opposing ideals and goals. But perhaps even they can learn to meet halfway...one small concession at a time.
I know it's too much to expect that everything will change at once, but...
I hope this crisis might at least help them take that first vital step forward.

I imagine that many changes are happening now all across Hoenn. I hope you will be able to travel this world and see its richness with your own eyes— and revel in its newness in your own heart.
But for the present, you may first wish to challenge this city's Pokémon Gym. There, you'll find the very same Wallace who helped us so much waiting for you. He's strong. But the way you are now, you should be capable of battling him on an equal footing.
People, Pokémon, nature itself... Our survival in this world depends on all of us living together in harmony. I feel I have just begun to understand that. And I'm wondering how the world will continue to change from this point on... It fills me with an inexplicable excitement.
@s...
@s...
As you and your Pokémon live and grow in this changed world, I wonder what effect it will have on you. What will you think about? What ideals will you believe in?
Until then...
Phew! Finally, it's just the two of us again. I've got to say...thanks for everything you've done for our region, @s.
Phew! It feels like we can finally relax, huh? I guess that now's the time to say thanks for all you've done, @s.
Anyway, you did something really amazing today, so try to take it easy for a while!
But...well, you did do something pretty amazing. So take it easy for a while, OK, buddy?
See you later!
Later!
The Cave of Origin, where all things begin... Mt. Pyre, where all things come to an end... Pokémon and humans both... Where do we come from? Where are we going?
The legend told by the old man on Mt. Pyre... It wasn't a made-up story after all...
The natural balance of things is going through a wrenching shift here in Hoenn...
What a...glorious turn of events...
Is it really? Ohohohoho! Is it really?
To think that this tree... I never knew we had received it from that huge man who visited from the Kalos region...
Goodness me, old master. This has been a learning experience. I thank you for this.
Ohoho! You're too kind, Master Wallace! Ohohohoho!
No, no, you're too modest. Hah hah hah... Now then...
Welcome again to Sootopolis, our new Champion, @s. Steven has told me everything. Do you wish to go to the Sky Pillar?
It is true the cave that leads to the Sky Pillar can only be opened by the hand of someone descended from the ancient people of Sootopolis...as, indeed, am I.
Or by one of the Draconids, who have also lived in Hoenn since ancient times...
The Sky Pillar is in fact an altar built for the ascension of Rayquaza—that Legendary Pokémon long said to be the protector of the Hoenn region.
Only the ancient Draconid people know how to summon Rayquaza to the Sky Pillar. Steven has told me of the woman Zinnia. She must be trying to revive Rayquaza for some purpose.
I shall go first to the Sky Pillar. When your preparations are complete, come join me. The Sky Pillar towers over everything upon one of Route 131's small islands.
Young Master Wallace headed to the Sky Pillar a short while ago. The Sky Pillar lies on a small island floating along Route 131.
Ohhh! You there! Young'un! You're the one who saved Sootopolis— No, you're the one who saved all Hoenn! Of all things! I really... I really must thank you most sincerely. I swear I will live what time I have left in this life to the fullest, thanks to you.
And when you travel the world, you should try to use this. This flute is one of my favorite items.
This Eon Flute is proof of the bond between you and your Latios.
No matter how far you may be from one another, play that flute and Latios will surely fly straight to you.
Then it can take to the sky, soaring above the land with you astride its back. Yes, just like when we first encountered Latias and Latios at Southern Island...
Look at how things have turned out, now the world's got its natural balance back... We've got to rethink this thing from the very start... We've got to redo everything we've done from scratch—and get it right this time. Whaddaya say? Maxie...
To set right the wrongs you've done, without running away in fear— isn't that how an adult accepts responsibility?
... Should you find the resolve to do so inside yourself, then I... Team Magma Admin Tabitha...
I will serve at your side as counsel forever.
If we do get the chance to meet again, I hope you will be able to show me and my team the answers you've found.
You know, I thought we were supposed to have set out from Littleroot together, but... But you, @s... It seems like you just keep getting further and further ahead of me... I even started to feel like you'd gone somewhere that I can't even reach.
It's pretty lonely, you know?
Not! What would you think if I really said something like that? Hee hee!
You know, we set out from Littleroot at the same time, but... It seems like you're just dashing ahead by yourself and leaving me behind... I feel like we're not even on the same level anymore, you know?
... It's kinda lonely thinking like that...
Or it would be if I really thought that!
Use the suit that you were just given. With that, it will finally become possible to stand up against the forces of nature.
My little scamp of a savior... Looks like we're making you bear all the burden on your little shoulders alone. I'm sorry for that. ...But I know you're going to see this through!
The fate of our world... The world upon which all humanity thrives... The fate of our world rests in your hands!
Because...
Because you... You're the best friend I have!
I'll always be right there behind you.
You're my best friend, after all!

Who might you be?
This is the Cave of Origin. The spirits of Pokémon, becalmed at Mt. Pyre, are said to be revived here.
Please leave.
...
Team Aqua...and Team Magma...
We have been expecting you.
Archie... I'm going to hand over that thing we developed to this kid. All right?
Yes.
The Aqua Suit. Take it...
This super high-performance protective suit was made with the combined technology of the Devon Corporation and Team Aqua! We actually prepared it in anticipation of coming into contact with Kyogre. I'll just leave it with you.
But... Even if you put that thing on, do you really think you'll be able to make it all the way down to where Kyogre waits?
The energy overflowing from this shrine is certainly much more powerful than we had anticipated. Its influence is making the current grow stronger.
There is nothing to fear.
The Red Orb he bears... Its ancient powers will protect both the boy and his Pokémon.
The Red Orb she bears... Its ancient powers will protect both the girl and her Pokémon.
Hmph! So that's it! Now that you mention it, I do remember the elderly couple at Mt. Pyre saying such... The Blue Orb is capable of releasing Kyogre's full power, of reverting it to its primal form. While the Red Orb has the power to quell that flood of power.
Yes. The energy overflowing from the Cave of Origin just now... It is the very energy that gives Kyogre its power. With the Red Orb, which contains the power to suppress that, it should be possible to calm the force of this great flood.
Of course the Red Orb's power alone will not lead you to where Kyogre waits. You will not reach Hoenn's Core that way.
@s... To think that you had the Red Orb...

You must go regardless of what awaits you inside that cave...

But I trust you to take care of this.
I'm begging, so... Save us... The world... And Kyogre...
If only I had an Aqua Suit, I could follow Kyogre all the way to the bottom of the sea! It's all up to you now!
I'm going to try to find what I can do to help, and then I'm going to do my best with that. And I'm going to keep on hoping and believing that you'll be OK out there, @s. Please...give it everything you've got!

... The land...or the sea... Humans...or Pokémon... When we sought to bring happiness to only one... we nearly destroyed both.
...Yeah. You're right.
Maxie... What you're saying is only natural. I know that. But still...
I can't just change... The world I believed to be ideal... The kind of world that I dreamed of making, where I could live alongside my beloved Pokémon... That hasn't changed. I know I've got nothing to stand on, after causing this much hurt, but...
That's right. You caused a big fuss there when you almost brought about the downfall of the world, you big dolt! No matter how much you beg, no one can forgive that!
But... Do you really need their forgiveness, though? Even if you are a big dolt who no one in the world will ever forgive...
Shelly...
Sorry...and thanks.
Hmph... We adults have a duty to pass this world along to the next generation. A world worth passing along. What is it we truly need to do to create such a world? Take each other's hand in friendship? Or fight for the right of supremacy? I think it is time we consider this again with our team members and break down the wall between us.
All right, ya little scamp. You managed to use that Red Orb, so now let's see you try this on for size. If you give it to Kyogre, you should be able to control its Primal Reversion.
Farewell.
See ya...
... Team Magma and Team Aqua are made up of people with completely opposing ideals and goals. But perhaps even they can learn to meet halfway...one small concession at a time.
I know it's too much to expect that everything will change at once, but...
I hope this crisis might at least help them take that first vital step forward.

I imagine that many changes are happening now all across Hoenn. I hope you will be able to travel this world and see its richness with your own eyes— and revel in its newness in your own heart.
But for the present, you may first wish to challenge this city's Pokémon Gym. There, you'll find the very same Wallace who helped us so much waiting for you. He's strong. But the way you are now, you should be capable of battling him on an equal footing.
People, Pokémon, nature itself... Our survival in this world depends on all of us living together in harmony. I feel I have just begun to understand that. And I'm wondering how the world will continue to change from this point on... It fills me with an inexplicable excitement.
@s...
@s...
As you and your Pokémon live and grow in this changed world, I wonder what effect it will have on you. What will you think about? What ideals will you believe in?
Until then.
Phew! And it's finally just the two of us again. So I've got to say...thanks for everything you've done for our region, @s.
Phew! It feels like we can finally relax, huh? I guess that now's the time to say thanks for all you've done, @s.
Anyway, you did something really amazing today, so try to take it easy for a while!
But...well, you did do something pretty amazing. So take it easy for a while, OK, friend?
See you later!
Later!
The Cave of Origin, where all things begin... Mt. Pyre, where all things come to an end... Pokémon and humans both... Where do we come from? Where are we going?
The legend told by the old man on Mt. Pyre... It wasn't a made-up story after all...
The natural balance of things is going through a wrenching shift here in Hoenn...
What a...glorious turn of events...
Is it really? Ohohohoho! Is it really?
To think that this tree... I never knew we had received it from that huge man who visited from the Kalos region...
Goodness me, old master. This has been a learning experience. I thank you for this.
Ohoho! You're too kind, Master Wallace! Ohohohoho!
No, no, you're too modest. Hah hah hah... Now then...
Welcome again to Sootopolis, our new Champion, @s. Steven has told me everything. Do you wish to go to the Sky Pillar?
It is true the cave that leads to the Sky Pillar can only be opened by the hand of someone descended from the ancient people of Sootopolis...as, indeed, am I.
Or by one of the Draconids, who have also lived in Hoenn since ancient times...
The Sky Pillar is in fact an altar built for the ascension of Rayquaza—that Legendary Pokémon long said to be the protector of the Hoenn region.
Only the ancient Draconid people know how to summon Rayquaza to the Sky Pillar. Steven has told me of the woman Zinnia. She must be trying to revive Rayquaza for some purpose.
I shall go first to the Sky Pillar. When your preparations are complete, come join me. The Sky Pillar towers over everything upon one of Route 131's small islands.
Young Master Wallace headed to the Sky Pillar a short while ago. The Sky Pillar lies on a small island floating along Route 131.
Ohhh! You there! Young'un! You're the one who saved Sootopolis— No, you're the one who saved all Hoenn! Of all things! I really... I really must thank you most sincerely. I swear I will live what time I have left in this life to the fullest, thanks to you.
And when you travel the world, you should try to use this. This flute is one of my favorite items.
This Eon Flute is proof of the bond between you and your Latias.
No matter how far you may be from one another, play that flute and Latias will surely fly straight to you.
Then it can take to the sky, soaring above the land with you astride its back. Yes, just like when we first encountered Latios and Latias at Southern Island...
Now the world's balance is restored to its natural state. Perhaps this is the time we must reconsider our ideals... Do you not agree? Archie...
I'll... I'll stay with you! I'll stay with you forever!
So, please... Stop going out on your own and acting crazy.
You're...our... Team Aqua's leader, and we're your friends, after all.
If we do get the chance to meet again, I hope you will be able to show me and my team the answers you've found.
You know, I thought we were supposed to have set out from Littleroot together, but... But you, @s... It seems like you just keep getting further and further ahead of me... I even started to feel like you'd gone somewhere that I can't even reach.
It's pretty lonely, you know?
Not! What would you think if I really said something like that? Hee hee!
You know, we set out from Littleroot at the same time, but... It seems like you're just dashing ahead by yourself and leaving me behind... I feel like we're not even on the same level anymore, you know?
... It's kinda lonely thinking like that...
Or it would be if I really thought that!
Use the suit that you were just given. With that, it will finally become possible to stand up against the forces of nature.
No. You are not acting as a mere child today. Trainer! I am sorry to say that we have put the greatest burden on your shoulders alone... But I trust you to take care of this.
I'm begging, so... Save us... The world... And Kyogre...
Because...
Because you... You're the best friend I have!
I'll always be right there behind you.
You're my best friend, after all!

Diving in the sea. Climbing up and down stairs all the time... If you live in this town, you end up getting physically fit.
I've never been out of this city. I wonder what the world is like on the other side of this round sky...
[~ 3]
Sootopolis is a city located in the center of a crater created by a big fallen meteoroid. If you look up at the sky, the lip of the crater is also visible. So all you see is a circle of sky. But that's what makes the sky above Sootopolis the most beautiful.
@s!
@s!
So you did come... I have been waiting for you. ... What terrible heat... It feels as though the entire world will be burnt away...
So you did come... I have been waiting for you. ... What terrible rain... It feels as though the entire world will be washed away...
Ah, yes. You need to hear what my friend has to say.
My name is Wallace. I'm this town's Gym Leader. I've also been entrusted with the protection of the Cave of Origin.
This drought is being caused by a power emanating from the Cave of Origin.
This downpour is being caused by a power emanating from the Cave of Origin.
That is the Blue Orb.
That is the Red Orb.
I see. Follow me.
This sunlight... People and Pokémon need sunlight to live... So why does this sunlight fill us with so much dread?
This rain... People and Pokémon need water to live... So why does this rain fill us with so much dread?
The blazing sun over Sootopolis is growing even more intense... Soon all of Hoenn will be caught under its withering glare...
The rain clouds massing over Sootopolis keep building... Soon they will extend over all of Hoenn...
If that were to happen...
[~ 21]
Let me guess, you're going to challenge Wallace? Oh, you are really? You're awfully brave!
Let me guess, you've beaten Wallace! Oh, you did, really? Maybe I'll become your fan!
Hm! You've come all the way to Sootopolis? You're no ordinary tourist. But I suppose that doesn't make you an extraordinary tourist, either.
A circle of the night sky framed by the ring of a crater created by a meteoroid... And in that ring, stars flicker and blink as if they were alive... It's my favorite scenery.

Oh... It doesn't matter... There's so much that I want to know...
Yay! I can climb up and down stairs as much as I like!
The round sky started smiling! Thank you!
We can look up at the sky again without worrying. It's all thanks to you.
Thank you for saving our city! I feel good vibes from you. Just like I feel good vibes from Wallace. No. Maybe even more!
Oh! Oh! You don't have to say anything. I know! Sootopolis was saved, all thanks to you! Thank you very much!
The sky is full of energy, so I'm full of energy, too!

Professor Cozmo! It's... It's a disaster!
The meteoroid's trajectory— it's suddenly changed direction! Now it's on a collision course with our planet!
WHAT? Recheck the data! Update the course calculations and confirm the new trajectory!
Target locked on! Confirming the meteoroid's new expected trajectory now...
According to the numbers, it should make impact... Somewhere southwest of Sootopolis, on a small island off Route 131!
But changing trajectories midflight... It's almost like it's alive.
But Professor, what should we do? WHAT DO WE DO?!
Calm yourself, man!
Y-y-yessir...
...Hmmn. So it's come to this.
Professor Cozmo. If I may interrupt you...
Ah, @s! Thank you for coming! And you brought the Meteorite Shard with you. Well done!
Oh! @s! Thank you for coming! And you brought the Meteorite Shard with you. Well done!
I was rather surprised to learn that you knew the professor. You really do seem to make connections everywhere you go.
Now then, Professor... Could I ask you to explain once more about the current plan?
Indeed... Please come this way.
I imagine that you've heard some of the situation from President Stone already. Our current plan involves using the Infinity Energy within our rocket, combined with the life energy of humans found in Key Stones... We will start off by artificially replicating the massive energy that is triggered at the time of Mega Evolution!
We will fire the energy produced from our rocket into space...
As a matter of fact, this technology already exists and has been incorporated in some of our commonly used devices.
An audacious plan... And using such technology you would... May I ask where exactly the asteroid will be warped to?
Well. We're not entirely sure, but... We do have a device that links the warp holes. We've named it the Link Cable.
But there's no need to worry. Based on our theory, we can at least guarantee that we will be sending it away from our planet. However, we've realized that we will need more energy than originally anticipated to control the Link Cable properly... I'm sorry to ask this of you, but with one more Meteorite Shard...
Nice! So this is the heart of the famous Space Center everyone talks about! Pretty impressive, huh, Aster?
Mur mur mur!
Excuse me! Young lady! You can't just let yourself in here!
Oh? Where's the harm in it? Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud! ♪
...Right?
Ugh...
Who...are you? You're no sightseer...
Oh me, we do seem to keep running into one another.
You are a busy boy, @s.
You are a busy gal, @s.
Wh-who are you?! What're you doing here?!
Me? I'm Zinnia. Just your regular ol' tourist, nothing more. Dreaming of taking a little trip into space... Heh.
Oh, I seeeeee... So this is what has come of human technology and of hope and blood and sweat and tears and... Well, the list gets kinda long and boring. But it contains everything, huh?
I know all about it. About just what kinda energy you're using to fuel this rocket thing... The abominable technology humanity first thought up 3,000 years ago...
So you're once again planning to claim that this is best for humanity, or best for the whole darn world... It's a snap of your fingers to repeat the sins of the past. Worse, if what I overheard is true... This time, you're about to commit an error more abominable than before!
Tell me, would you rather we sit here wringing our hands, waiting for that meteoroid to strike us?
Ahahahaha! What's up with that? You're a pretty simple guy for a former Pokémon League Champion.
Then I guess I'll hang my hopes on what our current Champion will have to say.
So how about it, @s?
So how about it, @s?
What do you think? Do you have some better idea?
You bet I do!
I've got nothing...
Oooh! Really? Well, that's promising... You'll have to tell me so we can set these guys straight.
Really? Too bad. Guess I was expecting more than I should have from you. Hey, that's fine, though. That's pretty normal.
Look, I'm not here to criticize the way you guys are looking at this. But I want to be sure you've thought this through well and good. You know, there are necessary sacrifices, and there are unnecessary sacrifices. What a disappointment! This is the best you could do with all your knowledge and technology? Instead of trying to make something outta nothing, you'd rather repeat the mistakes of the past, straight up? No, you're gonna add new mistakes on top—that really takes the cake.
You guys need some imagination.
...
Oops! But you were all in the middle of a conversation or something, right? Sorry about that.
I guess we'll just let ourselves out, then.
C'mon, Aster.
Mur mur mur!
... Who was that woman? And the way she spoke to us... It's almost as if she came here for some kind of confirmation...
Ah, Professor, forgive me. I believe you were trying to tell us something before that woman interrupted us?
Uh... Yes... Ah, you see... In order to complete the warp hole, we will need another Meteorite Shard, an extremely pure one...
Then should we head to Granite Cave once again?
No... The kind of Meteorite Shard we need this time can only be found at Meteor Falls.
Meteor Falls! I see... Perhaps we will learn something there...
I will head to Meteor Falls at once. Follow as soon as you are ready. I feel we might discover even more than a Meteorite Shard there...
I think we will be able to complete our preparations if we can get a Meteorite Shard from Meteor Falls. Young Steven has already set out. I trust you'll follow after him...
Your timing is impeccable as always, @s.

Are you trying to tell me that everything we've done up till now... The ties that bind us... all of it was a mistake? My bro has changed since he got mixed up with you!
How convenient it must be for you to put all the blame on another.
Grrr... Shut up! Enough! I've had enough of this world!
Shut it! I... I'm...
Aha! ♪ I know... ♪ Inside that rocket is the same amount— no, even more—Pokémon life energy than what powered the ultimate weapon in the war 3,000 years ago.
Know what? That rocket's full of crazy amounts of energy! It's even more awesome than the ultimate weapon that ended the war 3,000 years ago, right?
Wha—?!
Ahaha! ♪ I think we're in for an impact so big it will surpass the massive explosion that ended that war!
If I use this Key Stone I found at Meteor Falls, I can force the energy inside the rocket to explode... It'd be like Mega Evolution for the rocket! Muwahahaha!
I don't know what all this talk of a meteoroid is, but I have no need of it. Here, by my own hand... I'll make this rocket explode... And bring an end to this world...
Who needs a meteoroid? I'm gonna bring an end to all things with my own power!
I will...fix...Project AZOTH! Of course, I'll also destroy this dimensional shifter that's supposed to warp the asteroid away someplace, too. ♪
The one who will complete Project AZOTH and take the world back to its beginnings... is me!
...@s.
...@s.
This fool! This incredible fool really intends to do it! If we don't stop this now, our whole world will be embroiled in the destruction!
You're ready to battle...aren't you?
... Fine. I understand. You take things as seriously as ever. I suppose I should not expect less.
...Wonderful!
Don't. Get. In. My. Way.
Hoo hah! I'm gonna smash you up!
Why? Why must...you always... Always, always, always, always... Get...in...my...way!
Whoa... Ohh... Ohhh...
Darn! Dang it...
Dang it! Am I not good enough, bro?!

Aster snatched the dimensional shifter away from Matt!
That Pokémon... Doesn't it belong to...
???: Nice one, Aster!
You're the—!
The Draconid, yup. Or you could just call me Zinnia.
Aster!
Murrr!
Thank you, dear.
Now then...
That is an impressive machine. Snap your fingers, the asteroid vanishes, and we all live happily ever after?
Ahahahah! Indeed! It's like that former Champ said! This thing is the best hope we have of saving this planet and everything on it.
But you know...
It could also be the worst tragedy imaginable for some other world and everything on it.
...What are you trying to say?
I'm not talking to you. You don't get it.
Ugh...
But you, @s...
But you, @s...
Hope for our world... Tragedy for another... You get it, don't you?
I do.
I don't.
And you come through again! You never disappoint me.
I suppose not. I'm not that surprised. It's pretty normal you wouldn't.
My people know it. From generation to generation, we pass along the lore about the distortions in the world borne by the Mega Evolution mechanism. And about the existence of another world, which we have long observed to be just like this one and yet not the same...
That's right. A Hoenn region that's almost exactly like this one we live in. Filled with Pokémon and people like us. A world where maybe the evolution of Pokémon took a slightly different path, where Mega Evolution is unknown... A world where that war 3,000 years ago...never happened. A world where the ultimate weapon was never even built. And in that Hoenn of that world...
What would happen if one day, out of the blue, a meteoroid appeared? What would happen to the people of that world, without the technology to destroy the meteoroid or the power to warp it away?
... Looks like it's beyond the power of your imagination.
Zinnia crushed the dimensional shifter in her hand!
What kind of fool are you! You have no substantive proof, and yet you claim another world, one just like our own, exists? Out of this fantasy, you—you have destroyed our only hope!
What have...you done...
Farewell, brief hope...
Y-you! Do you even know— Now what are we to do?!
Calm down there, Prof.
It'll be OK. I... We... We can protect this world...and the other.
Who exactly is “we”? What are your intentions?
Oh yeah! Silly me... I forgot the other thing I came for.
Wha-what...
?!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone away from Courtney!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone away from Matt!
Wha... Errgh!
Wha... Errgh!
And that's the Key Stone gotten... Now I'll put it together with the Key Stone they've got in their base...
Murrr!
Looks like my next appointment is calling, so I'll excuse myself now.

Our...leader... Leader Maxie's... Key Stone. Is she trying... to steal it?! No...no...

Confound it all... So she must be making for Team Aqua's hideout next...
Confound it all... So she must be making for Team Magma's hideout next...
Ah... That's it. That woman... That “Zinnia”... She mentioned the Sky Pillar. Few can enter it—only the successors of the ancient world, who know of what has been... The Lorekeepers who are tasked with passing on that knowledge to those who come after...
@s! I have been expecting you!
@s! I have been expecting you!
Do you remember Wallace, whom you met in Sootopolis?
Is that right? That is a relief.
Is that right? That's rather sad for Wallace...
The Gym Leader of Sootopolis, Wallace, should know how to undo the seal on the Sky Pillar's entrance. He is also one of the few humans to have inherited such ancient lore.
I will remain here and work with the professor and his team to devise a plan for what to do next. That woman...Zinnia... I cannot put my faith in her. We will think of a new way to stop the meteoroid on our own.
Zinnia...and the Sky Pillar... I will leave them in your hands. I will send a message to Wallace for you, so he knows to help. You will probably find him in the Cave of Origin in Sootopolis.
... Leave me alone...
Sniffle... Blech... Gross...
M-Miss...Courtney... You don't have to act tough in front of me...
Matt... I'll stay by your side...
This is no time to lose heart! I've somehow got to find a way to repair the dimensional shifter!
There's an array of computers. They look expensive. The monitors show numbers scrolling rapidly.
The energy reading appears to be diffusing!
W-we can confirm that the meteoroid has been destroyed, sir!
Puh... P-P-P-P-P-P-Professor!
The meteoroid! The meteoroid—it's—! Thank the powers above! It's—!
Calm yourself, man!
Oh, who am I kidding! I'm so happy, I could kiss you! We did it! We actually did it! Wahahahaha! Success is ours!
Hahahaha...ha... Hah...
Thank you, @s.
Thank you, @s.
Oh my goodness! Hello again!
We all wanted to thank you for what you did! Because of you, our world has been saved!
Quite so. No matter how much we thank you, it could not possibly suffice. We do indeed thank you most heartily!
My assistant here will show you the latest test results.
Oh, quite so! Wonderful idea.
We've continued studying the meteoroid that threatened us, and we've learned something.
When you faced that falling meteoroid... Did you perhaps encounter a certain Pokémon?
Extrapolating from the energy readings we observed seems to show evidence of the Mythical Pokémon that lives in space: Deoxys.
When we try to track its biological signal, it seems to have merged with the meteoroid at some point during its approach. We have come to the conclusion that it was purposefully aiming for Hoenn.
As for what could have drawn it to Hoenn in company with that meteoroid... Well, we haven't yet found a plausible reason to explain that aspect.
But at the very least, we do not believe Deoxys has come to destroy Hoenn... Nor to harm this world.
What reason could Deoxys have to seek out the Hoenn region? We will continue to investigate that topic.
If you learn anything new about Deoxys, please let us know at your earliest convenience.
Ah, yes. There is one more thing we can tell you. We have detected the biological signals of Deoxys here in the Hoenn region, as well. We were able to track it to somewhere around Route 131, but that's as precise as we could get. If you're curious, perhaps you could look into it.

Hm... You know, seeing that white beauty there that you travel with... I'm reminded of the Legendary Pokémon Rayquaza, said to descend at the Sky Pillar. I once had the chance to see it face to face. Although, it was a long time ago now... The young man who battled against Rayquaza beside me... I wonder whatever happened to him and that black Charizard of his... Well, regardless—you must go to the Sky Pillar and see what waits for you there. I don't know what you'll find. Be careful.
And create a “warp hole.”
By creating a warp hole in the path of the incoming meteoroid, we hope to be able to transport it somewhere far away from here.
I think you know what I mean. Those panels that spin you about and then out you come, warped to another spot. I imagine you've stepped on a few such?
And yet... I feel as though I should know her from...somewhere.
Think, Steven. Think! What to do, what to do...
@s handed over the Meteorite Shard to Professor Cozmo!
That girl who passed by... I was petrified by the overwhelming strength that I could feel from her!
Problems just keep popping up one after another... We're supposed to be carving out a bright new future with power of science, but... but this mess... Sigh...
I got the Meteorite Shard from young Steven. Now if we can just harness this energy and complete our device!

I'd like to protect the rocket... But I'd like to protect myself, too...
A rocket launch demands perfection. Not even a 1 percent margin of error is allowed. Even if it's 99 percent OK, the whole thing is useless if 1 percent happens to be no good. Despite that, we never stop trying. Why? It's a dream that never ends.
Those thugs... Are they after our rocket?!
I was taking a stroll down the beach when I found this. It's not anything I need, so you can have it.
The Hoenn region has been famous for its meteor showers for a long time.
Wh-wh-why? I heard on BuzzNav that Team Whatsit cleaned up its act!
Some people claim that Pokémon came from space. Could it be true?
Whoooooooa! ...I'm saying something that I can only say at a time like this.
I'd like to go to space with my Pokémon for a rendezvous in the starry sky!
I also like to have rendezvous with the wrong sort of people, like them...
This rocket! Thick!
I saw quintuplets for the first time! I kinda feel lucky!
A giant chunk of metal bursts through the sky and flies into space... It boggles my mind!
Whaaat? Those thugs! I'm so flabbergasted, I can't move!
I'm sorry, but we're in the middle of something right now and can't let you go upstairs.
I shouldn't have let any scoundrels go upstairs... But I'm petrified and can't move...
Hee hee hee!
We finally meet again.
It's been three— Hm? How long has it been?
Nincompoop! It doesn't matter!
Brace yourself! We won't let you call us mere quintuplets!
Hah, hah, hah... I knew we would lose...
I wanted to win in style like the Hoenn Rangers!
It's odd. That strategy—Intimidate five times in a row— should be invincible... Did you cheat? Grumble, grumble...
Nincompoop! You're strong, aren't you? Stop whining!

Ah... Yes... I suppose I should welcome you to my home. Please forgive the rather sparse décor... Now, where to begin...
Let us take a moment to understand what is happening to our world right now.
That rumbling that shook the earth just now... The eardrum-rupturing explosion we heard... They are proof that a seal, which was long hidden deep undersea, has been undone at last.
The super-ancient Pokémon that has been sealed deep beneath Route 128 since ancient times... It slept until now in the Seafloor Cavern. The entrance to that cavern was sealed by the power of a certain Pokémon, all in an effort to keep any human or Pokémon from ever breaching it. But now it appears that the scheming of that terrible team has undone the seal. There is no doubt that they intend to revive the super-ancient Pokémon. And once they do so, it seems they hope to make its power their own.
@s...
@s...
If that team obtains the power of the super-ancient Pokémon, it will upset the balance of nature in this world. A crisis unlike any other before it will befall every living thing on this planet. I plan to do everything in my power to quell this situation. That is my duty. But there is a limit to what I can do with my power alone... That is why I am asking for your help. I have great faith in your abilities. Lend me your strength to help put a halt to these Teams' mad ambitions! With you and I and our Pokémon all working together, we will overcome this disastrous turn of events. I don't think it is out of the question.
I will entrust you with this.
If you use Dive, you will be able to dive to the ocean floor with your Pokémon.
And take this so you can stay with your Pokémon even in the depths of the ocean...
If you were to use Dive in the correct stretch of water along Route 128... I believe you should be able to reach the entrance to the Seafloor Cavern.
I will join you when I finish my duties.
Please do what you can to stop Team Aqua and Team Magma until then. I am trusting you to do this for me!
@s checked the Poké Ball. It contains the Pokémon Beldum. Take the Poké Ball?
@s obtained a Beldum.
You cannot carry any more Pokémon!
@s left the Poké Ball where it was.

Dear @s...
Dear @s...
I have something in mind, so I will be away in training for some time. I do not expect to return to my home anytime soon. Which brings me to a request. I want you to take the Poké Ball that you should find on my desk. The Beldum inside is one of my favorite Pokémon, so I hope you'll treat it like one of your own. Trusting we will meet again,                            Steven Stone
[~ 28]
It's a collection of rare rocks and stones assembled by Steven.
...
A careful look reveals a postscript.
P.S. I had sent you another Beldum, rather a special one. Did it reach you safely? Of course, both are cool and sublimely strong. I trust they will teach you the joys of Steel-type Pokémon.

Hey there, Trainer! A Super Rod really is super! Say whatever you want, but this baby can catch Pokémon right off the seafloor! What do you think? You want one, don't you?

If there's any water, try dropping in your line and see what bites!

The Gym Leaders in this city are a formidable duo. Their combination attacks are, like, excellent and wow!
Pokémon that live in the sea and in caves and things are really, really good at hiding. If they catch even a glimpse of you, they'll be gone in an instant! And sometimes you really feel like you can sense a Pokémon around, but you still won't be able to find it unless you can actually see it with your eyes. You have to spot 'em first, and then sneak up slowly! That's the trick!
I'm going to win a whole lot of Link Battles, and me and my Pokémon will charm everyone! We'll have tons of fans all over the world. That's my ultimate goal!
Aha! Pokémon Journal The effects of Secret Power and Nature Power depend on the location. Misty Terrain and Grassy Terrain also change their effects.

Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be @s?
The Gym Leaders here use Psychic-type Pokémon. If you go up against them with Fighting- or Poison-type Pokémon, they'll do horrible damage to your Pokémon!
They'll come at you with outstanding combination attacks! If you want to win, you'll need to show them how tight you are with your Pokémon. Go for it!
Wow, you're astounding! You're one great Trainer!

@s received the Mind Badge from Liza and Tate.
The Mind Badge has the power to make all Pokémon up to Level 80, including those you've received from other people, obey you!
It also enables Pokémon to use the HM move called Dive!
And take this, too!
Calm Mind...
...comes from relaxing your mind and concentrating.
Pokémon's Sp. Atk and...
...Pokémon's Sp. Def...
...will be heightened by this move!
It's a perfect move for Psychic-type Pokémon!
Looks like the bond between you and your Pokémon is far stronger than the bond we share as twins... But you'll go on from here to form even more bonds! That's the future I see for you!
There may be a harsh ordeal ahead for you and your Pokémon... But that's all right! You and your Pokémon aren't alone! You have each other! That's why we want you to face whatever troubles may come your way head-on and full of courage!
Oh, you only have...
...one Pokémon to battle.
Then we can't battle you!
We want to battle you, so please bring more Pokémon!

Revives are fantastic! Give one to a Pokémon that's fainted, and that Pokémon will be revived. But be careful. Revive won't restore any PP that has been used up by its moves.
Max Repel can keep weak Pokémon away. And it lasts the longest of all the Repel sprays!
Net Balls and Dive Balls used to be Mossdeep's specialties. A Net Ball is effective against Bug-type and Water-type Pokémon. A Dive Ball works best on Pokémon at the bottom of the sea.
Hey, you! Quick question! Do you want a TM?
I see. If you want to get it, let me know.

I got this from Steven, but I don't know what it's good for. I think it's called King's Rock. Do you want it?
Why would you want it? You're weird. You can keep it, but don't tell Steven I gave it away.
Is it really that fun collecting rocks? I don't get it.
Yeah, you think so, too! What are you supposed to do with some weird rock?
Around Mossdeep, you can see wild Wailmer. It's called, uh... What is it... Wai, Wai, Wai... Wailmer watching!
The island's Space Center has been launching huge rockets.
I'd heard from my mates in Lilycove that the herd of Wailmer has disappeared. I wonder what went down over there.
Wouldn't it be nice if this island—no, the whole world—was burgeoning with nature?
All life needs water to survive, even though it makes its home on the land. And all life, having run its course, becomes soil and returns to the land. Thus the waters of the sea are always connected to the land.
Yes, like the very shoreline here.
A voyage on a ship is fine. But crossing the sea with Pokémon using Surf... Now that's an exhilarating trip! Wouldn't you agree, youngster?
This rock has a special meaning to the people at the Space Center. They put it here as their wish for their rockets to fly safely. When you make a wish, what do you use? Do you wish upon a star? I use a wish tag to make it happen. That's what I do.
It's a white rock.

Wha—whaaa—whaaaat?!

That direction... Is that the direction of Route 128?
Whoa! Dude! Seriously, dude!
Heeeeeeeeeh... This is the end of the world...
Skitty! Don't worry! Calm down!
Skidddddy!
Oh man! So cold... Steven, please do something.
Oh man! So hot... Steven, please do something.
In this horrible weather, we can't enjoy Wailmer watching...
What's up with this weather? I wonder if the rocket launch may be suspended for a while because of this weather...
My friend in Lilycove told me the weather there is horrible, too. What in the world is going on here in Hoenn?
If this weather stays like this, all plants and flowers will be withered. I can't accept that! Ever!
Is this weather trying to return everything to the sea...?
Is this weather trying to return everything to the land...?
I learned this from the breaking news on BuzzNav. Apparently, this weather is being caused by something in the sky in Sootopolis.
I've kept wishing on this rock in the hopes that this weather will return to normal as soon as possible.
Liza and Tate in Mossdeep Gym have very mysterious powers. Their powers are paranormal... Like Psychic-type Pokémon! If you have any trouble, you may want to visit the Gym.
I feel it... I feel the tremendous Pokémon power that can even change the weather...

Oh, my, my! Are you traveling alone? But you're so young! Good for you! I'm sure my kids could learn a thing or two from you! Me? I'm a Pokéblock Master. If I get just a little serious, why, I can concoct great Pokéblocks. Would you like to learn from me, a Pokéblock Master?
Oh? Are you sure? You shouldn't always try to do everything by yourself, dear!
Oh, good! You're a smart soul! This is a bit long, so listen up! Are you ready? If you want to make great Pokéblocks, you should choose Berries with the same color, if possible. Don't forget that! A good Pokéblock improves the condition of your Pokémon a lot, so it's very useful. And this is also important. If you blend rare Berries with the same color, it's more likely that you'll get great Pokéblocks. And another thing. There are rare Pokéblocks called Rainbow Pokéblocks. You have to make these with all different-colored Berries. It's hard to make them, but they improve all conditions at once, so if you like that, it's worth making them. That's about all you need to know to make good Pokéblocks. If everyone had Pokémon they love, Berries, Pokéblocks, and a loving family, the world would be a happier place. Don't give up, dear!
When my wife gave birth to quadruplets, you bet I was shocked. But, now, seeing them play together, it makes me happy.
I like Pokéblocks, but I prefer giving Poké Puffs to my Pokémon.
I heard that sometimes awesome Pokéblocks can be made!

I want to brag about how tough my Pokémon is, so we're going to enter a contest together.

The most popular contest idols now are Lisia and Ali! They're incredibly strong! You seem to have potential, but compared to them, you still have a long way to go.
Ah! You're so popular... You're strong and very kind to your Pokémon. You're just perfect! I...I want to be your fan forever!
I came all the way from Kanto to see Lissi! I wonder if they'll ever make it out to my hometown.
I've become your fan! When I go back to Kanto, I'll spread the news about how great you are! So please come to my area, too!
I have no idea if you have a natural talent for performance in a contest. However! I know! I know the strongest and cutest are Lissi and Ali!
I became your fan after I saw you in the contest the other day! You seem to have gained quite a bit of popularity, I must say. However! Only I should know your true greatness. I want to keep it all to myself!
My girlfriend is super cute, but Lisia is as cute as her, too!
Whoa! @s! Just as I imagined, you're really cool! You're great in a Contest Costume, but you look sharp in your everyday clothes, too! Oh... Don't stare at my girlfriend too much. I'm worried you may steal her heart.
Whoa! @s! So...so cute! You're great in your Contest Costume, but you look cute in your everyday clothes, too! I like you even more!
We're Lissi's fans! I always play Lissi and Ali with my boyfriend. I play Lissi, and he plays Ali.
Yeeek! @s! You look so cool in person, too! My boyfriend is really cool, too. But a real star's coolness is a whole different level of coolness!
Yeek! @s! You look so cute in person, too! You're so cute that I'm worried that you may steal my boyfriend's heart! But you're so cute!
Roseli! Roseli. ♪ (It looks like it's showing off Altaria Ali's picture...)
Selia! Seliaaaaaa!! (Roselia appears to be extremely excited to see @s...)
The person who shines the most in Hoenn is, of course, Lisia!
Whoooa! This brilliantly scintillating aura! You must be @s! I'm so glad that I believed the rumor that I could meet you here! You shine the most in Hoenn! There's no doubt about it.
Contest Spectaculars don't interest me at all, but if I can be like Lisia, I may give it a try!
Wow, @s! I bet you have a lot of fans—is it OK for a celebrity like you to walk around here? If pesky fans bother you, let me know. I'll protect you!
Awwwww... Lissi is too cute. I'll quit my job and follow Lissi.
Whoa! You're a celebrity! A star! If such lucky encounters keep happening to me, I'll quit my job and support @s in every Contest Spectacular!
Oh, my dear Lisia... Please come to the Pokémon Center in my town to restore your Pokémon. I'd like to allay dear Lisia and Ali's fatigue...
My dearest @s! I...I...I am a huge fan of yours! I've been eagerly waiting for you to come to our Pokémon Center! I have always watched you in contests, and I always will!
You have so many fans! @s, you're a real star! We, your fan-club members, will keep supporting you forever. You're our shining star, @s!
Um...
Li... Lissi!
Hey! It really is you, @s! I saw you coming in here, so I wondered what was up! Tee hee! A little get-together with your fans, is it? Have fun!
Hey! It really is you, @s! I saw you coming in here, so I wondered what was up! Tee hee! A little get-together with your fans, is it? Have fun!
Li... Lissi is so cute...

Hoo, boy... Master Rank contests, here I come. The world will know that my dearest Pokémon is the cutest being in all existence. The time has come! Uheheheh.
You can see a whole variety of Pokémon here. That's why I make this place a regular part of my daily stroll.
[~ 31]
[~ 32]
The Toughness Contest is like extreme, man! Those muscular appeals... Cascading sweat... I swoon!
Day in and day out, I lavished my care on this Pokémon. Its condition is peaking. Today, victory is mine!
I got a present from a girl who said she was my fan! Hmmm, I've never gotten a present from a girl before. To be honest, it made me really happy!
It's a big machine with a speed indicator and a meter.

I was away awhile, so I was surprised to see there is an exhibit on the second floor, too. I wish someone would paint my Pokémon this pretty.
Well...this is where they display the paintings that everyone has been talking about recently. I see. These new paintings are indeed full of vigor and are fascinating.
Wow, is that right? The models of portraits here are your Pokémon. Isn't that just the ultimate joy for a Trainer?
I think I saw the contest when this portrait was painted! I always watch your contests, though. Thank you for always giving me such a fun time!
[~ 21]
Oh, it's you! I'm the curator here. Do you remember me? As I promised, I displayed your Pokémon's portrait art here! Yes, just as I imagined, the modern touch is pretty good, too.
Thanks to you, new styles have been added to this museum. I'm happy about that.
By the way... Thanks to you, we were able to display so many portraits. Let me thank you properly.
The past, the present, and the future... I'd like to collect all kinds of marvelous art here in Lilycove Museum!
It looks like a place to display a portrait of a Pokémon that performed well in a contest.
This is a portrait of [VAR PKNICK(0001)], which performed well in the [VAR 01A2(0000)] Contest!

Welcome to Lilycove Museum. Please take the time to enjoy our collection of fantastic artwork featuring Pokémon.

[~ 5]
I'm the curator of this museum of fine arts. Well, aren't they all fantastic pieces of art with history? Huh? The second floor? Well... I've been thinking about displaying something different— something more lively—on the second floor.
It's a very old painting. The paint is peeling here and there.
It's an odd landscape with bizarre and fantastic scenery.
It's a painting of a beautiful, smiling woman with a Pokémon on her lap.
It's a painting of a Legendary Pokémon from long ago. The artist painted this from their imagination.
It's a painting of Grass-type Pokémon in a breeze. They appear to be enjoying the wind's gentle caress.
It's a delicious-looking painting of Berries. This painting could make you hungry!
It's a famous glass sculpture. It depicts an ancient bird Pokémon.
It's a big Poké Ball carved from a black stone. It was apparently used in festivals in the olden days.
It's a huge stone tablet inscribed with Pokémon and dense text in the small characters of an ancient, unreadable language.
Hmmm... What works of great magnificence...
Battling with Pokémon is fun, I'll grant you that. But one mustn't forget our love for the fine arts.
At this art museum...well, you can see many fantastic paintings. And the curator is a wonderful person. Among artists like myself, this museum is an inspiration.
This lady is pretty! She's like Mommy!
This Pokémon is adorable! Just like our little boy!
I'd heard that this art museum got a new painting. So naturally I hurried over. Is the new painting up on the second floor?
Lately, the curator has been unusually cheerful. I bet something good happened for him. Definitely.
I aim to see many great paintings here and learn from them. I have this dream of one day having my artwork exhibited here.
The art museum has become a favorite tourist destination. It's great for Lilycove... No, great for the Hoenn region! This is what I've heard—a lone Trainer is responsible for all the paintings upstairs.
I asked this museum to display my art, but they turned me down! What kind of museum doesn't appreciate my art? Yeesh. Anyway, how about you? Are you interested in my art?
Oh! You're the one who appreciates my art! I know! You're interested in buying another piece of my art today, right?
Fine. We artists are lonely by nature.
Yay! I'm so glad that I finally met a Trainer who appreciates art! I'll specially sell my art for $100,000 a piece to you. Which one are you interested in?
Paradoxical Popper
Meditative Seat
Heterarchical Loop
Not interested...
A Paradoxical Popper! There's no point in just selling it. Let me talk about my thought behind this art first. ... You suddenly feel empty! You wonder if you're worthy in this world. You worry that you may be forgotten without producing anything. You feel living may be meaningless! But you still live! Finally, you'll discover the limitless possibilities in yourself and in the life you thought was empty! This art represents that! I'll sell this to you for $100,000. Will you buy it?
A Meditative Seat! There's no point in just selling it. Let me talk about my thought behind this art first. ... What you are looking at now? Does it really exist? All may not exist! When you realize that! Your world will lose its light! And what you'll have is a void without light... But because of that, you feel it! You feel something with substance! You feel a powerful life! This art represents that! I'll sell this to you for $100,000. Will you buy it?
A Heterarchical Loop! There's no point in just selling it. Let me talk about my thought behind this art first. ... Do you have a bright future? Your next step... Will it really create your future as you wish? You get frightened! You may not escape from this chaos ever again! But no matter what kind of future awaits, you still nervously take a step wondering what kind of future unfolds! This art represents that! I'll sell this to you for $100,000. Will you buy it?
I'm thrilled! Thank you! Please display it.
You don't have enough money. I can't lower the price once I set it for my art. Sorry.
You've already bought enough of them! Quantity is not always better when it comes to art.
There are pamphlets that read “Welcome to Lilycove Museum” on the rack.
It's an old-style picture of a popular Trainer of the past.
It's a sculpture depicting Shroomish. It's created by an up-and-coming artist.

I'm the Game Director. It sure is fun filling in the Pokédex, isn't it? If you do complete yours, come and show me!
I'm the Game Director. Oh, let me see your Pokédex... Whoa ho! You've registered all of Hoenn's Pokémon! You did it! This is spectacular! You have to let me reward you!
I'm the Game Director. Oh, let me see your Pokédex... Whoa ho! Unbelievable! You've completed the Pokédex! To think that you would actually bother to catch them all... I'm just so delighted! You have to let me reward you!
I'm the Game Director. Now, let's see your Pokédex... Wha— Wh-what is this?! This [VAR PKNAME(0000)] here! It has had quite the long journey to make it here, hasn't it? You must really care deeply for this [VAR PKNAME(0000)], huh? I'm moved by such powerful bonds. You have to let me reward you!
I'll send this special certificate to your Secret PC for you! Put it on the wall in your Secret Base!
I'm the Game Director. Why, hello again! And what a surprise! Here you are again today, with yet another well-traveled Pokémon! Shall I reward you and [VAR PKNAME(0000)] for your loyal relationship?
Oh, yes? So you just came to show me, did you? Well, thank you for that kindness! You take care of that [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!
I'm the Game Director. Oh! You're a real Pokédex master! You've completed the whole thing, and you're still out there playing! Thank you so much!
I'm a programmer! That's right! I managed to make the screen loading a bit quicker this time around!
Hey! I'm the game planner! Hehehe... We put lots of fun new stuff in this one for you!
I'm a graphic designer! Please fully enjoy the great natural beauty of Hoenn with your favorite Pokémon!
Raff raff! Whiiine...
The girl Tubers are cute, hey? To battle against a cute Tuber... Whoop! It drives me wild! And the Twins! Aren't they cute? A two-on-two battle with Twins... Whoop! It's unbearably fun!
All of us GAME FREAK staff came here for a little company getaway. The sea breeze really tickles my heart. It feels just wonderful here!
No matter how you look at it, it has got to be a safe!
It's a hanging scroll with the art of a famous calligrapher on it! You can't even begin to guess what it's supposed to say!

Hm, so they doubled the guests by using Pokémon as attractions? Hm, well, maybe I should make a cute Pokémon our motel's mascot. I wonder if that will attract more guests to stay with us.
Oh, sorry, sorry! I was so absorbed in watching TV! Since that Team Aqua came to town, the tourists have been staying away.
Oh, sorry, sorry! I was so absorbed in watching TV! Since that Team Magma came to town, the tourists have been staying away.
Hey, down in front! I can't see the TV!
Amazing! A Pokémon found someone's lost item! That's cool. If we had some smart Pokémon like that, we could recover anything mislaid by our guests.
Oh, sorry, sorry! I was so absorbed in watching TV! I heard that someone busted the Team Aqua Hideout. Thanks to that, a big group made a reservation with us. It was a company called...uh... GAME something...

Amazing! A house-sitting Pokémon caught a burglar? That's something. If we had a tough Pokémon as a security guard... We would be able to provide our guests with greater safety.
Oh, sorry, sorry! I was so absorbed in watching TV. Oh, yes. A big group of guests arrived a little while ago. They made a reservation as GAME FREAK, so I guess they must make games. Uh-oh, I'd better get working on their dinner!
Hey, hey! Don't go in there. That's our kitchen!
Whoa! What a surprise! I didn't know a Pokémon was here. Food has been disappearing lately, so I thought something was going on. This Pokémon shouldn't be living here without my permission. Harrumph! But, taking a closer look, this Pokémon seems cute, smart, and tough... Hey, you. Do you want to be our Pokémon? We provide three square meals a day.
Kec! Kecleeee!
I see! You want to be our Pokémon! I hope you'll do a great job as our mascot Pokémon! The fate of our motel depends on you!
Kec! Keclecleee!
Amazing! A house-sitting Pokémon caught a burglar? That's something. If we had a tough Pokémon as a security guard... Perhaps, we should start training our Pokémon to be able to provide our guests with greater security.

There's an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
@s slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Pokémon became visible to the naked eye!
There are a lot of souvenir goods unique to Cove Lily in Lilycove.

I wonder how many kinds of Pokémon there are in the world. I'll trade Pokémon with people in faraway places via the PSS, so someday I can collect all the Pokémon!
I've been hearing about some rotten scoundrels who are nabbing people's Pokémon. I hear one even stole a Meteorite!
Those rotten scoundrels who were stealing people's Pokémon and Meteorites... I don't think I've seen them around lately.
Aha! Pokémon Journal Just like Poison-type Pokémon being immune to poison, Ghost-type Pokémon can flee regardless of Mean Look and Shadow Tag.

Heeey! @s!
Don't tell me... Are you here for the shopping, too, @s?
We're right in front of the famous Lilycove Department Store, after all!
When I saw you, I figured maybe you'd come here to do some shopping, same as me.
I'm afraid I already bought up tons of stuff! Like Pokémon Dolls...and posters...and...
B-but— That's not all I've been doing, of course! I've also caught tons of different Pokémon, and I've been raising them well, too!
Really?
Hm...
Gasp! You doubt me?! Harsh!
Aughhh! You think I'm lying, don't you! That little hum totally said you think I'm lying!
I think the bigger question here is whether you're raising your Pokémon right, not me!
S-so that settles it! Let's have a battle!
Let's test my team and see how they stack up against your passion for Pokémon, @s!
[~ 13]
Ahhh, this reminds me of the battle I had with you back on Route 103!
You were able to become this strong because you battled me back then, right, @s?
...What would you think if I said something like that?
Hee hee...
I'm actually thinking that it's about time I went back to Littleroot, though.
I've caught a lot of different Pokémon, and my Pokédex is pretty complete, so I think I should go show it to my dad.
...Huh? Did something just...sparkle in your Bag? It was like the light from that Meteorite...
...Oh, nothing! Sorry! Just forget it! I'm probably just imagining things!
@s, what are you going to do? You going to collect all the Gym Badges and take on the Pokémon League challenge?
Typical @s! Then while you're collecting your Badges, I guess I'll go and complete my Pokédex!
What, really? Well, now you've got me curious! If you aren't focusing on the League, then what else are hoping to achieve? I can't wait to see what you'll do!
I guess I'll be off, then!
But let's definitely meet up again somewhere!
Hm?
Hey, if it isn't @s! Did you come to do some shopping, too?
[~ 29]
You know what I'm talking about... The Lilycove Department Store! My dad asked me to pick him up a few things here.
It's not like I'm here to buy Dolls or something, r-right!
A-anyway, it feels like it's been ages since we last ran into each other.
How about I battle you so you can see which one of us is doing a better job raising our Pokémon?
Though I think you and I both know who the winner is gonna be, @s!
Boy, that stings a bit... I had a head start on you as a Pokémon Trainer, but still...
I, uh... I'm planning on going home to Littleroot.
You know how I've been helping out my dad with the Pokédex, and it's been coming together pretty decently. So...I ought to go back home and show it to him.
@s, what are you gonna do? You still thinking of collecting all the Gym Badges and taking on the Pokémon League challenge?
Yeah? I guess I'm not surprised. Do your best. You know I'm behind you. ...Uhhh. Huh? Did you... @s, I think there's something... There's something, like, sparkling in your Bag... It's the same kinda light as that Meteorite had, the one you showed me in Lavaridge...
Huh? Really? I've gotta say, I always kind of thought that you'd go all the way and aim to be Champion. ...Uhhh. Huh? Did you... @s, I think there's something... There's something, like, sparkling in your Bag... It's the same kinda light as that Meteorite had, the one you showed me in Lavaridge...
Ahhh, never mind! Just... Good luck out there!
Muahahaha! We moved more loot into our secret hideout today...
Wh-who are you?! I was just talking to myself!
I'm just a Grunt, so I have no idea what the Boss is thinking... That's OK with me, though! If I just stay on Team Aqua, someday I'll be able to do something awesome! Someday I'll be big time!
Wh-who are you?! I was just talking to myself!
Hey, you! Don't go near the cave in the cove! Why? You don't need a reason why! I'm an adult, so you just listen to me!
If this whole wide world becomes ours, Team Aqua's, then the 101 Skitty at my parents' house and the Wailmer that live with me should be happier, too!
There, Wailmer! Now leap out of the water and turn!
Huh? What do you want? You're messing up our training, so can you, like, get lost?
Fufufu... We've finished moving more loot into our secret hideout today.
Wh-who are you?! I was just talking to myself!
I have no idea what the Boss is thinking... I'm still here, though. To me, being here with Team Magma is the only chance I have to make a real connection with someone...
Wh-who are you?! Don't stand there without my permission listening to me talk to myself!
Hey, you! Don't go near the cave in the cove! Why? You don't need a reason why! I'm an adult, so you just listen to me!
If this whole wide world becomes ours, Team Magma's, everybody back home in the country, my Ma and Pa, my little sisters and brothers, cousins and second cousins... I'm sure everyone will be happier!
There, Wailmer! Now leap out of the water!
Wh-who are you?! You're getting in the way of my training, so get lost!
A great variety of Pokémon have gathered to show off how cute or tough they are in the Contest Spectacular! Me, I love a great variety of Pokémon, so my heart is pounding with anticipation!
Have you seen that strange cave in the cove at the edge of town?
I'm going to teach my Pokémon some new moves for the Contest Spectacular! That's why I'm headed to the Move Deleter to make my Pokémon forget HM moves.
The Hoenn region shines with the beauty of its waterways and verdant nature. It makes me realize that it's just as lovely a place as my home in the Kanto region!
Team Magma's been training their Wailmer in the cove. We sailors can't get our boats out to sea with them in the way!
Team Aqua's been training their Wailmer in the cove. We sailors can't get our boats out to sea with them in the way!
Ahoy! Have you heard? Someone punted Team Magma out of the way for us! That got the Wailmer out of the way, so we can get our boats out again!
Ahoy! Have you heard? Someone punted Team Aqua out of the way for us! That got the Wailmer out of the way, so we can get our boats out again!
I was at the seaside inn, enjoying a relaxing snooze to the sound of waves... When someone stole my Pokémon! Who's the abductor?! Team Magma? Is it Team Magma?!

Hmm, you know of the peculiar cavern in this cove? It was a natural formation, but then that Team Magma lot came along and made their renovations. They say they're “Team Magma, for humanity,” but to us they're just a big pain!

This is where fans of Contest Spectacular Trainers hold passionate discussions every day.
To commemorate our first meeting, how about a contest quiz? What Pokémon does Lisia the contest idol always have with her? Try and show me!
I expected nothing less from you! Your Altaria looks pretty amazing, too, doesn't it? You can make it, can't you?
Yeah, yeah, hang in there!
Too bad! A miss!
It's so hot...
It's so cold...
This may not be the time for the Contest Spectacular, but it's at times like these that we should do our best to enjoy our time.
According to breaking news on BuzzNav, this aberrant weather is only having an effect on Sootopolis and surrounding areas... At least for the time being...
When the weather's as out of hand as this, there's no way I can go out to sea.
I'll refrain from letting my Pokémon play outdoors for a while... I wouldn't want my Pokémon to come down with something—nor me, either!
I am a painter. To have the luck to encounter aberrant weather such as this in my lifetime... With this extraordinary world before my eyes, my creative juices are really flowing!
This weather... Facing adversity like this makes my blood boil... Honey? Fuhoho fuhohoho...
When my husband proposed to me here on this spot 60 years ago, the weather was just like this... Mufufu mufufufu...
Just when I thought those bums from Team Aqua had finally calmed down, along comes this aberrant weather... I can't relax at all!
Just when I thought those bums from Team Magma had finally calmed down, along comes this aberrant weather... I can't relax at all!
I went to all the trouble of wearing a suit, only to have it ruined by this weather...
No matter what the weather's like, you better believe I'm going to the Contest Spectacular! At least as long as Lisia is there!
Hey now! I won't let you go any farther down this beach! After all, our hideout's down there! Wheeze, wheeze!
Hey now! I won't let you go any farther down this beach! I mean, our hideout's down there! Cough, cough!
Whaaailll!

We can give you hints on how to enjoy your base, and items you can't get anywhere else! And, best of all, coming here means that you can always meet me! Anytime you want!
Y'know, @s, that reminds me... You still haven't made yourself a team, have you? See, a team is made up of, like, the pals that hang out in your base with you. I guess you could just call 'em friends, but doesn't “team” sound cooler? When you meet people in other bases, you can ask 'em to join your team! Nothing wrong with playing alone, course, but having some pals around sure can liven things up in your base! If you haven't tried it yet, I think you oughta give it a shot before you write it off!
Mm-hmmm! I get it. So you made yourself a team, huh? Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]! Yeah, it sounds like it's full of adventure! Not a bad name at all!
Oh yeah! You've been collecting flags, little pal? Here at the Secret Base Guild, we assign ranks to all the teams based on how many flags they've managed to get, see. The more Secret Bases you find and the more flags you snag, the higher you and your team will end up in the ranking!
Huh? You wanna know why we do that? Ain't it obvious? It's more fun that way! A bit of rivalry gets everybody fired up! And doesn't it seem full of adventure to be on an endless hunt for more flags? The higher your rank gets, the richer your base life will become. You'll see! So go out there and find those flags, and then bring 'em here to show me!
So lemme give a gift to my fellow base fanatic, for coming so far to see me here!
A Proclamation will let you set the battle format that will fly in your own base. There are lots of Decorations with special and cool effects like that! Whenever you get a new bit of swag for your digs, check it out to see what it does! And enjoy the base life!
Hi! Do people tell you that you look like [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR 010E(0000)]?
Oh... Then what do you think you look like?
I knew it! I just knew it!
Oh, [VAR iCOLOR2(0001)][VAR 010E(0001)]! Now that you say it, I think you're right.

Yo-o-o-o, @s! Didja need me for something?
Yo-o-o-o-o, @s! So you finally reached [VAR 01A9(0003)]! I knew you'd be the one to do it for me, if anyone could!
See, truth is... There's something I've been keeping to myself. There's an even higher rank you could achieve. It's a secret rank, get me?
And that rank is called [VAR 01A9(0003)]! You'll need a frankly freakish [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)] flags in order to go up in rank again, though! I know, I know, right? It's a crazy number. Maybe too big for anyone to ever hit. But I just don't wanna put a limit on how much adventure waits out there!
C'mon, @s! Make yours the grandest adventure yet!
Let's see those flags.
Let's have a battle!
How about a picture?
Nothing.
All right! I'll accept that challenge! Oh, yeah. So the battle format here in the Secret Base Guild is Single Battles. Sound good?
I'm good to go anytime! Just come talk to me!
Good work out there, @s! Phew! Battling you felt like a real adventure! Let's do it again sometime!
Sounds good enough! Me and Flygon have gotten stronger. The battle format is still Single Battles, of course. You cool with that?
Good job there, @s! You're pretty good at Pokémon battling, too, huh? Let's do this again sometime!
OK, let's see here... Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Wow! That's [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)]! And you need [VAR NUM6(0004,002C)] flags to move up to the [VAR 01A9(0003)]! Typical [VAR 01AA(0001)]! You hardly even broke a sweat, didja? Here ya go! Proof of your new rank!
You received the [VAR 01A9(0005)]!
Team [VAR 01AA(0001)] has reached the [VAR 01A9(0003)]! Now your Secret Pals will be able to use [VAR NUM1(0006)] special skills!
Oh yeah! One more thing! Take this while you're here!
Now that you've reached [VAR 01A9(0003)], I wanna see you have a real fine adventure! Next up is [VAR 01A9(0007)]! You'll need [VAR NUM6(0004,002C)] flags for that! The hurdle has gotten higher, but I know you'll do it for me, [VAR 01AA(0001)]!
Oh! I remembered something else! You oughta check out the shop, 'cause more will be available now that you've gone up a rank! Good luck to you! Have an awesome Secret Base life!
OK, let's see here... Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Wow! That's [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)]! And you need [VAR NUM6(0004,002C)] flags to move up to the [VAR 01A9(0003)]!
Just what I'd expect of Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]! So you made it to [VAR 01A9(0003)] at last... I can just feel the adventure waftin' around you! Your team really is something, you know? Almost too much something... Ahhh, so excited I nearly forgot to give you your proof!
You received the [VAR 01A9(0005)]!
Team [VAR 01AA(0001)] has reached the [VAR 01A9(0003)]! Now your Secret Pals can use all of their special skills!
This is a little present for Team [VAR 01A9(0003)]!
Hrmmm. I've gotta capture this super moment forever somehow...
That's it! So you'll never forget the thrill of adventure when you reached [VAR 01AA(0003)]... How 'bout we take a picture of Team [VAR 01AA(0001)] right now? That's it! I'm a genius!
Now that it's decided, I can't wait another moment! You'd better get ready, too, @s!
All right! Everybody's here, yeah? Then here we go... Say cheese!
[VAR 01AA(0007)]!
And it's...perfect! Man, what a great shot!
Man, I'm gonna keep this photo in the album in my heart forever! ...You and your teammates sure are super, you know? A super team... The Super Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]! That's what we oughta call you! You keep having a blast with your Secret Base out there, pal!
OK, lemme see here... Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]'s flag collection is now all the way up to... That's [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)]! And you need [VAR NUM6(0004,002C)] flags to move up to the [VAR 01A9(0003)]! ...
S-seriously? [VAR 01AA(0001)]! [VAR 01AA(0001)]!!! You guys have finally reached [VAR 01A9(0003)]! I've never seen anything so super! That's it! I'm giving the best-ever certificate to the best-ever team!
You received the [VAR 01A9(0005)]!
Team [VAR 01AA(0001)] has reached the [VAR 01A9(0003)]! Now your Secret Pals will be able to use special skills twice a day!
And I've got a gift for the best-ever team, too!
And I'll give you this fella, too! It doesn't do a thing for me and my loyal Flygon here... But you get the adventure of battle, so I figure you oughta be up for it!
There's nothing left I can even say! You are a Secret Base master! I just hope you'll keep showing others the adventure that awaits in base life! I'll always be here, of course, so feel free to stop by anytime!
Looks like you haven't made a team for yourself yet. Try getting some pals together! That's the first step!
OK, lemme see here... Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Whoa! That's [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)]! Just what I'd expect of Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]! There's nothing left I can even say! I hope you'll keep showing others the adventure to be had in base life!
OK, lemme see here... Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]'s flag collection is now all the way up to... Oooh. That's [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)]! And you need [VAR NUM6(0004,002C)] flags to move up to the [VAR 01A9(0003)]! Looks like you still need [VAR NUM6(0007,002C)] more. Hmm. I guess you oughta go check out lots of other people's bases, huh?
OK! I'm gonna take a picture! Get ready!
Super! Another awesome shot! If you ever wanna retake your photo, just say the word!

The tree houses of Fortree are great! I think it's the number-one town for living together with Pokémon.
Pokémon and people have adapted to nature to survive. There's no need to make nature conform to the way we want to live.

Huh? What is this? What is it holding?

People... Pokémon... Their hidden powers are awakened by living in natural environments...

I hold a coin in my hand. Now tell me, which hand holds the coin, the right hand or the left?
Right hand
Left hand
You are correct! Let us try again.
Yes, correct again! We shall try once more.
Splendid! Your hidden power has awakened! Here, take this and awaken the hidden power of your Pokémon.
Hidden Power varies in type depending on the Pokémon using it.
No, too bad. You guessed wrong.
The area around Fortree City is like a jungle. It gets awfully tiring walking around this city. That's why I use Fly to effortlessly reach any city I've visited.

Thank you! I'll be good to your [VAR PKNAME(0002)], so please be nice to my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Wait! That Pokémon isn't [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR PKNAME(0002)]. I guess you don't want to trade with me.
Oh, OK. If you change your mind, please come see me. I'll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me! I really wanted this Pokémon, so I promise to take good care of it!
Sorry! I can't trade with a person who has only one Pokémon.

I recognize your talent and present you with this Gym Badge.
@s received the Feather Badge from Winona.
With the Feather Badge, all Pokémon up to Lv. 70, even those received through trades, will obey your every command. You will also be able to use the HM move Fly outside of battle.
And this... This is a gift from me.
Roost... With this move, the user can restore its HP by up to half of its max HP by landing on the ground and resting its injured body. However, the user loses its Flying-type designation during the turn, so be cautious.
You won against me... I know you'll keep aiming higher and higher! Someday, you may even fly up into the sky... That's the impression I get from you.

I have my pride-and-joy Pokémon with me. This time, I'll beat Winona.
The ground absorbs rainwater, and trees grow by drinking that water... Our Fortree City exists thanks to our having both earth and water.
This city's homes are built on trees. Perhaps because of that lifestyle, everyone seems healthy and lively. Why, even I do! I feel as if I've grown 30 years younger since I moved here.
Living on top of trees is fine. But sometimes Bug Pokémon come in through the windows. It can cause quite the fright!
Some Pokémon evolve when you Link Trade them with friends.
There's an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
@s slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Kecleon became visible to the naked eye!
The startled Kecleon fled!

That determined expression... That limber way you move... And your well-trained Pokémon... You're obviously a skilled Trainer! No, wait, don't say a word. I can tell just by looking at you. I'm sure that you will be capable of putting this HM to good use. No need to be modest or shy. Go on, take it!
Any Pokémon that's learned Cut can chop down prickly trees if the Trainer has earned the Stone Badge. HMs like this can be used outside of battle, too, with the right Badges!
My dad helped make Rustboro City what it is today. He had his Pokémon use Cut to clear the land of trees and expand the city.

Hee hee hee, ooh, this is so exciting!
But that's no [VAR PKNAME(0002)]. Tsk. So disappointing.
Aww, it's a good Pokémon...
Don't you get curious about what other people named their Pokémon?

The blackboard lists status changes that may affect Pokémon in battle.
Which topic do you want to read about?
Poisoned
Paralysis
Sleep
Burned
Frozen
Cancel
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP. The poison won't disappear after the battle, either. Heal the condition using an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat of a Pokémon and may prevent it from making any moves. Paralysis also lingers after battle, so use a Paralyze Heal to free your Pokémon from it.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to attack as long as it is sleeping. The Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if the battle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep. You can wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces a Pokémon's Attack stat and steadily reduces its HP. It will remain after battle. You can cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely helpless. It will remain frozen after battle. Thaw it out using an Ice Heal.
Students who don't study get a little taste of my Quick Claw, you see. Whether or not you are a good student will be evident from the way you use this item.
A Pokémon holding the Quick Claw will occasionally speed up and get to move before its opponent, you see. There are many other items that are meant to be held by Pokémon. Just those alone will give you many topics to study!
I'm trading Pokémon with my friend right now.
I always wanted a Seedot, and I'm finally getting one!
Pokémon can hold items, but they don't know what to do with man-made items like Potions and Antidotes.
You know how some Pokémon moves can confuse a Pokémon? A confused Pokémon will sometimes attack itself without meaning to. But once it leaves battle, it will return to normal.
A Pokémon holding a Berry will heal itself... There are many kinds of items that Pokémon can hold... Boy, it sure is hard taking all these notes...
It's this student's notebook... Pokémon are to be caught using Poké Balls. Up to six Pokémon can accompany a Trainer. A Trainer is someone who catches Pokémon, raises them, and battles with them. A Trainer's mission is to defeat the strong Trainers and Gym Leaders who await challengers in Pokémon Gyms.
Hey. I'm not a weird man. I'm the head of this school. To prove that, I'll share some knowledge with you.

If you have a Stone Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 20 will obey your every command.
If you have a Knuckle Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 30 will obey your every command.
If you have a Dynamo Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 40 will obey your every command.
If you have a Heat Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 50 will obey your every command.
If you have a Balance Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 60 will obey your every command.
If you have a Feather Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 70 will obey your every command.
If you have a Mind Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 80 will obey your every command.
If you have a Rain Badge, all Pokémon will obey your every command.
Which Badge do you want me to explain?
Stone Badge
Knuckle Badge

Heat Badge
Balance Badge
Feather Badge
Mind Badge
Rain Badge

I'm Mr. Stone, the president of the Devon Corporation. I heard just now how we have quite a bit to thank you for. So you helped out my staff not just once, but twice! There's a favor I'd like to ask of a reliable Trainer like you.
Now I want you to know I'm a president you can trust. I'd never be so mean as to ask a favor for nothing in return. Here, give me your PokéNav Plus for a moment.
Mr. Stone updated your PokéNav Plus! You can now use the BuzzNav function on your PokéNav Plus!
The function that I just added to your PokéNav Plus is called BuzzNav. It is an indispensable tool for any Trainer who is traveling out in the world. Use it, and you'll be able to get the latest news from around the region and from your own friends, anytime and anyplace. Now let me get to the important issue of what it is I need you to do...
I want to ask you to deliver this Letter to a man named Steven. You should find him in Dewford.
You'll have to cross the sea to reach Dewford, of course. I'll ask Mr. Briney, the old sailor who lives in that hut on Route 104, to help with the crossing. Go find him, and he should agree to help you. I'm counting on you, young trainer! If you're ever unsure of what to do, just come and talk with me again!

Since my youth, I've immersed myself in work. Consequently, I'm not very familiar with recent trends and that sort of thing. Do all young people want to be Trainers and aim for the Pokémon League, I wonder?
This is the top floor of the Devon Corporation. Our president's office is on this floor. I can't tell you how grateful I am for what you've done for our company. Could you wait here for just a moment?
Our president would like to have a word with you. Please come with me.
Please, go ahead.
Mr. Briney is an old and dear friend of Mr. Stone's. The two of them, along with one other friend, used to travel all the corners of the world together in their youth.
Two of Devon's greatest-ever products, which took the world by storm! They are the Repeat Ball and Timer Ball!
It's a fancy display of all the rare stones the president has collected.

Ahem! Oh, I know. I know what you want to say. My, what a hasty, impatient one you are! What are we to do with such an impatient one for our Pokémon League Champion?
...Hm? Oh, is that so? So you're the new Champion, @s?

Now then, @s.
Now then, @s.
I'm afraid that I'm planning to start in on a rather long and quite heavy topic.
Are you sure that you're ready to take all of it in?
I guess so...
Not really.
Hmph. Well, if you're not ready, then I guess that's that. When you do start to feel ready, come to talk to me again.
Hmm... Then I suppose I should begin. Let me first take us back 3,000 years, to the days when this story began...
There was a great war at that time, in a region far from here. That war was finally brought to an end by a weapon created by one man. And what energy source could power such a dreadful weapon? Do you know? You see... It ran on the life energy of Pokémon.
The energy that could be gained by the sacrifice of so many Pokémon... There are surely many people who would call it reprehensible. But my grandfather, the president of Devon before me, said this... “Couldn't we use the energy to improve the lives of people and Pokémon?” And so he developed our greatest creation here at the Devon Corporation: Infinity Energy.
Thanks to Infinity Energy, Devon was able to become one of the top industries in Hoenn and developed into the giant you see today. You may be surprised to learn that the Devon Parts you once recovered for us were in fact parts of a motor that would make it possible to power a submarine using Infinity Energy.
It was not long before we began to expand our attempts to further human development. Next, we moved into exploring space. The rockets launched from the Mossdeep Space Center using our Infinity Energy... They are the true results of our dreams, our passion, and our technology. But never did we imagine they could end up as the best hope for saving our world.
My preamble has been quite long, but we arrive at last at the real issue. That is the overwhelming catastrophe which now approaches us. A huge asteroid, more than six miles in diameter, is currently on track to collide with our planet.
We have been working together with the Mossdeep Space Center, which was first to recognize this danger. We are devising countermeasures that would use our rockets, but... In order for these plans to succeed, though, we need a Meteorite Shard.
So that's it... You want h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer to go and get that shard for you.
Hah! That's my boy, all right! I knew you'd understand at once.
It was hardly a deduction worthy of praise...
I want you to make your way to the Granite Cave near Dewford. According to our surveys, you should be able to find the kind of Meteorite Shards that we need there. And you, Steven... I want you, Son, to head for the Space Center at once to start the preparations, using that Link Cable that I gave you.
The Link Cable? So it is to be a warp system... Yes, I understand. But Granite Cave... Ah. I see. The floor where we first met— the floor with the ancient wall paintings. It is true that there were many shards of meteorite scattered about there.
It looks as though it's decided then, @s. I will head for the Space Center in Mossdeep.
It looks as though it's decided then, @s. I will head for the Space Center in Mossdeep.
If I learn anything, I will contact you at once. Though it will end up as another one-sided message like the one I sent you, I'm afraid.
Good luck.
...Steven? You be careful.
Then...I will be counting on the two of you to take care of this for me. If you forget just what it is you need to do, come talk to me again... Assuming I remember as well! Ho ho...
The last hope of humanity... If we lose the dimensional shifter now, we will have no way to stop that asteroid from striking our planet...
The dimensional shifter was destroyed by one of the Draconids...? Why...? Why would the Draconid people...?
Thanks to the heroic actions of you young people and your Pokémon teams... we have been able to dispel the threat of the asteroid without a single loss! Perhaps I have put too much of my faith in technology's promise alone. Perhaps my belief that the sacrifice of some might be necessary to guarantee the safety of many— Perhaps it was wrong all along.
My father is... Well, let me just say that I have been his son for 25 years, and sometimes even I am not sure I understand him fully.
Hm? Ah. That Intriguing Stone you have... On second look, it seems to be Pidgeotite, doesn't it?
To be carrying around a Mega Stone like that... It looks like you're also a bit of a connoisseur.
We had to do a whole lot of research into Mega Evolution to develop Infinity Energy. It was all based on the legend of Rayquaza that the Draconid people passed down for the past several thousand years.
What do you say? Since you did work alongside us to save the world and all, I guess I could tell you about my research results... Want to hear about them?
Understood! Ahem... To begin...
It appears that within Rayquaza's body resides an organ with the same power as a Mega Stone. I have dubbed it the mikado organ. We believe Rayquaza usually inhabits the stratosphere, where its instincts prompt it to consume small meteoroids that fall into the atmosphere. The meteoroids merge with Rayquaza's internal energy to create an effect similar to a Mega Stone. We believe that, thanks to its mikado organ, Rayquaza can undergo its own Mega Evolution, manifesting sufficient power to repel both Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. As we can gather from legends, Rayquaza has swooped in to put a stop to their clashes many times in the long history of the world.
Those who saw the way that Rayquaza, possessing this special power, reacted to their Key Stones to transform itself, began research into the subject. It came to be recognized as a form of Evolution, a new possibility for Pokémon. And what we stitched together from all of this long research is the current theory of Mega Evolution.
A part of Rayquaza's entry in the Pokédex was even edited due to this bit of folklore.
...Ahem! And that, while simplified quite a bit, is what I have deciphered from the ancient records of the Draconid people about the relationship between Rayquaza and Mega Evolution.
Oh... Well, that's a real shame. If you ever find yourself interested, just come talk to me again!
Oho! Th-that Pokémon you have... Could it be that rare white specimen? There cannot be more than one such specimen in the world! So pure... So sublime... Its sparkle is indeed the ultimate! I would love to see how it would stand up to Steven's Beldum...
I want you to go to Granite Cave. Based on our research, you should find the kind of Meteorite Shard that we will need. I'm counting on you.
Steven seems to have headed out for Meteor Falls. I sure hope he'll find something useful there...
Steven headed for the Mossdeep Space Center a little while ago. I hope you'll deliver the Meteorite Shard to him at once. I'm counting on you!

We're developing a device for talking with Pokémon. But we haven't had much success...
I'm developing new kinds of Poké Balls... But I haven't made much headway...
We've finally made some new kinds of Poké Balls! The Repeat Ball makes it easier to catch Pokémon you've caught before. The Timer Ball gets better at catching Pokémon the longer a battle runs. Both are proudly developed by the Devon Corporation. Please give them a try!
I made the PokéNav Plus! As an engineer, I feel blessed to have made something so great!
Wow! That's a PokéNav Plus! It's a navigation system for connecting people, Pokémon, and the world! That was the idea of our president, and I made it a reality. Would you like me to describe its features in detail? No, no. I think you'll find out just by trying the PokéNav Plus for yourself.
I'm trying to develop a device that visually reproduces the dreams of Pokémon... And I've heard that my rival, who lives far away, is doing the same research! I can't lose this race.

Hello, and welcome to the Devon Corporation. We are the proud producers of items and medicine that enhance your life.
One of our research staff went and got robbed of something important.
Hey, that PokéNav Plus! That's one of our products! It makes me happy when I see people using something we made.
That stolen case... Sure, it's important, but it's not like it would be much good to anyone else. Because those who know about the energy are... ...No! Nothing! Nothing, really! Uhahaheh...
It sounds like they've recovered the stolen Devon Parts.
I'm sorry, but only authorized people are allowed to enter.
It's beyond stupid. How could he get robbed like that?
Hi there! You're always welcome here!

My Pokémon has a Naive Nature, and my friend's has a Jolly Nature. It's fascinating how Pokémon have personalities!
I heard that Pokémon Centers had two stories up until around 10 years ago! And they used to have a special area called a “Pokémon Cable Club”!
The man next door gave me an HM! I used it to teach my Pokémon how to Cut down spiky trees.
Hmm. Has anyone told you that you have the looks of a Schoolkid?
Hmm. I see. Then what do you look like?
Just as I thought. That's the look.

Yo, how's it going? Listen, my friend! Would you like to become the Champion? I'm no Trainer, not me, but I can sure give you winning advice.
That's settled, then! We'll aim for the Pokémon Championship together! It's your job as a Trainer to collect Gym Badges, am I right? But Gym Leaders aren't pushovers! And that's where I come in! I'm here to provide expert advice!
Roxanne, the Gym Leader here, is a user of Rock-type Pokémon. The Rock type is very durable, but it can't stand Water-type and Grass-type moves. Come see me afterward if you beat the Gym Leader. Well, go for it!
Whoa! What a breathtaking victory! My cheering must have worked! Great! Check your Trainer Card. The Stone Badge you got should be recorded on it. In other words... You've climbed the first step on the stairs to the Championship! Very promising!

I understand. The Pokémon League's rules state that Trainers receive this if they defeat a Gym Leader. Please accept the official Pokémon League Stone Badge.
@s received the Stone Badge from Roxanne.
The Stone Badge enables Pokémon to use the HM move Cut outside of battle. All Pokémon up to Level 20, even those you get in trades, will also obey you. And... Please take this with you, too.
The move Rock Tomb not only inflicts damage by dropping rocks, it also lowers the target's Speed. If you use a TM, it instantly teaches the move to a Pokémon. You can use a TM as many times as you want, so please try it out!
Since you are so strong, you should challenge other Gym Leaders, too. By battling many Trainers, you'll likely learn many things.

Hello. You must be a new challenger.
I am Roxanne, the Rustboro City Pokémon Gym Leader.
I became a Gym Leader so that I may apply in battle all that I've learned at the Pokémon Trainers' School.
If you defeat me in a Pokémon battle, I'll present you with a Gym Badge as proof of your strength as a Trainer. Please take up the challenge.
I look forward to seeing you as a challenger. Until then, farewell.

Congratulations on becoming the Champion. I sometimes remember the day I handed you the Stone Badge. I felt so uplifted from our battle! It would make me happy if we could battle again someday.
I have a friend who shares my keen interest in collecting stones. His name's Steven. He's known for his serious expression, but when it comes to rare stones or Steel-type Pokémon, his eyes light up. He gets animated, and his expression changes, showing an unexpected charming side.

I'm buying some Antidotes in case I run into any Shroomish in Petalburg Woods.
My Pokémon evolved and has lots of HP now. I should buy some Super Potions for it instead of ordinary Potions.
I'd sure like an Escape Rope in case I get lost in a cave. With an Escape Rope, it only takes a second to get back to the entrance!
Excuse me, Trainer over there. Do you have a minute? You know, sometimes moves are too strong to catch a Pokémon. You end up making a Pokémon faint even when you don't want to. For such a common problem, use this!
False Swipe is a very handy move. No matter how many times it's used on the opposing Pokémon, it won't cause the Pokémon to faint! I'm offering it for free right now. This is a limited-time promotion!

The Devon Corporation... That's kind of a mouthful, so we just say Devon. The company makes all sorts of convenient products.
Hm? Did I see a sneaky-looking man? Come to think of it, yes! A shady-looking fellow just went around the corner there.
Have you taken on a Pokémon Gym yet? Once you get a shiny Gym Badge in your hand, that's when you really start to feel like a Trainer.
Hey, that's Rustboro's Gym Badge! Out of all the Pokémon Gym Badges, Rustboro's is the coolest, I'd say.
Oh? Who might you be? You're a new face around these parts. Have you just transferred into the Pokémon Trainers' School?
I challenged the Gym Leader, but... It's not going to be easy winning with my Fire-type Pokémon. Fire-type Pokémon don't match up well against Rock-type Pokémon.
Every now and then I see that old sailor who lives by the sea, Mr. Briney, taking a stroll through the tunnel.
That old sailor who lives in the cottage by the sea said he was going shopping in Slateport for his Pokémon, Peeko. Mr. Briney must really love that Peeko of his.
Oh, you are with your Pokémon! When I'm an adult, someday I'll go places with Pokémon, too.
So this is the Pokémon Trainers' School! If I enroll in this school, do you think I'll be able to catch rare Pokémon easily, too?
If a Pokémon gains experience through battle, the way it looks can sometimes change!
Pokémon can change the way they look? That could be quite a shock!
A Pokémon you get in a trade from someone else grows faster. But if you don't have enough Gym Badges, it may not listen to you...
Out of the way! Move it!
Wait! Pleeeaaase! Don't take those parts!
Oh, you there! You're that fantastic Trainer who helped me in Petalburg Woods! Help me! I was robbed by Team Aqua! I have to get the Devon Parts back! If I don't... I'm going to be in serious trouble...
Oh, you there! You're that fantastic Trainer who helped me in Petalburg Woods! Help me! I was robbed by Team Magma! I have to get the Devon Parts back! If I don't... I'm going to be in serious trouble...
I think that shady character took off toward the tunnel over there.
Oh! How did it go? Did you get my Devon Parts? You did! You got them back! You really are a great Trainer! I know! As my thanks, I'll give you a Great Ball!

Once I catch a couple more Pokémon, I'll be sure to take it on with my team! See you later!
Hey, @s. How's your Pokédex? Completed any entries yet? Mine pretty much rules. I went on a Pokémon-catching frenzy in Petalburg Woods until I ran out of Poké Balls!
Oh! Hey, @s! Have you been catching lots of Pokémon? I'm doing pretty good on that front, at least. I caught so many Pokémon in Petalburg Woods that I ran out of Poké Balls!
Oh, yeah. I passed by Mr. Briney in Petalburg Woods. I bet he was on his way home to his cottage on Route 104.
Oh yeah... And I passed by Mr. Briney when I was in Petalburg Woods. Hmm. I guess he must have been on his way home to his cottage on Route 104.

@s, you just moved here so there's no way you could know, but Mr. Briney was once a highly respected seafarer.

Oh, @s, you made it! I'm sure sorry to call you all the way out here. Well, I've got a favor I need done right away. I've mentioned this before, but that bright, flashing light on top of that tower means something may have happened in New Mauville! That's why I called you here. I want you to go check on things in New Mauville.
There's just one thing, though. New Mauville is usually a prohibited area. Back in my day, it was just locked up normally, but security has been evolving, too!
Don't you go anywhere just yet...
Hey, thanks! I just took a picture of your eyes. Now if we just use the computer to transmit this data...
Now if you go to New Mauville, the doors will open automatically! The Basement Key has what they call “iris recognition.” When you get inside, go press the button on the computer in the back. When that computer starts working right, come back here and report to me. I sure am sorry to bug you with all this, but I'm really counting on you!
All righty then, I'm counting on you for that investigation of New Mauville! You can Surf from Route 110 to get to New Mauville.
You're @s, right? Thank you for taking such good care of my husband. I do apologize for all the trouble that we may cause you, but please do find some way to forgive us.
Plah! Plah!
Mah... Mah... Mah...
Oh, @s! Sorry to make you come all this way. You went out to New Mauville, right?
The results of your investigation have been sent here to my computer, too. The most important thing is that there don't appear to be any abnormalities for the time being. Let me give you this as a way to say sorry for causing you such a hassle.
By the way, there wasn't anything going on in New Mauville, right? That was supposed to be a new town, though... We should've been able to build a huge underground city stretching down into the depths.
Things happened, and its development had to be suspended. Since then it's just been left to rot. All the equipment inside might have seen better days.
The New Mauville Development Project... The development itself was really smooth. Just when its completion was right before our eyes, though, we discovered a problem. We realized that if we built a town where people could live, it would have a negative impact on the Pokémon that live there. Since then development has been on hold. New Mauville has been abandoned...

Hey there, Trainer! This is your first time here, right? This food court is a bit strange, so there are some rules you have to follow before you eat. I come here all the time, so I can tell you about them.
Number one! Place your order at the counter! There are three items on the menu here, so order whatever you like. When you're done ordering, the restaurant staff will give you a buzzer. Number two! Sit in a chair while you wait for your food! It may take a while for your order to be ready. Have a seat and wait. Here's the important part! While you're sitting and waiting for your food, others will come and battle you for your seat! You have to fight back if you want to eat the meal you ordered! Number three! Eat your food! When the buzzer goes off, it means that your order is ready to be picked up at the counter. All that's left to do then is to sit back down and eat! What do you think? Easy, right?
Well, you've come all the way here, so why don't you order something? Since it's your first time here, maybe you should order the Village Sub Combo. That restaurant is a chain from Unova that just opened here! It's easy to eat, so it's pretty popular with kids who like Single Battles.
All right then, see you later! Enjoy your time at the Mauville Food Court!
Hey there, Trainer! As long as you're here, do you have a minute?
I guess the trend is dying out already. The line of customers waiting to order Magnemite Croquettes has disappeared. Magnemite Croquettes are a Mauville specialty. They're made with batter containing a blend of several kinds of broth, grilled on a piping-hot hot plate, and coated with specially made sweet, sour, spicy sauce from Johto! They're a cheap gourmet food that's all the rage with couples and young people who like Double Battles.
You should definitely give them a try, too! Well OK then, see you later!
Oh, Trainer! As long as you're here, do you have a minute?
Maybe it's because we've had fewer amateurs coming in these days... The line of customers lining up for a Mauville Ramen Bowl has finally cleared out. The noodles are soft like Jigglypuff's cheeks (not that anyone would ever consider biting them...), the soup is golden like lightning, and the ingredients are piled as high as Mt. Chimney. It's a local Mauville specialty that even makes discerning people who like Triple Battles say, “Wow!” Mauville Ramen Bowls are an edible legend here at the Mauville Food Court.
You want to try it, don't you? You have to come prepared if you want to eat a Mauville Ramen Bowl, though... See you later, Trainer! I look forward to seeing you again sometime!
I lost... That chair... I had always felt out of place at home, at school...everywhere. That chair was the only place I could ever relax... That's why I crushed everyone who tried to battle me for this seat. In time I became like the ruler of this place... I became the Fare Prince! ...But that's all over now. ...It's over for me. I realized something during my battle with you, Trainer. I don't need to find my place... I need to make a place for myself.
Trainer... I can no longer call myself the Fare Prince... The title is yours now. And so, from now on, you will be Fare Prince the Second! I've decided to go make a place for myself.
Trainer... I can no longer call myself the Fare Prince... The title is yours now. And so, from now on, you will be the Fare Princess! I've decided to go make a place for myself.
The next generation... Take care of Mauville Food Court for me! I hope I can see you again somewhere someday! OK then, see you later!
Your buzzer is buzzing! Time to go get your food!
Would you like to order the Village Sub Combo? That will be $[VAR NUM5(0000,002C)].
Presenting the Village Sub Combo, a low-priced combo meal with a Berry sandwich and fried Berries! It's wildly popular with kids who like Single Battles!
Your order has been placed, so please take this buzzer. Your meal will be ready in [VAR NUM1(0000)] turn[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s. Please have a seat and wait.
I am terribly sorry to have to tell you this, but you don't have enough money.
I am quite sorry, but would you be so kind as to bring at least [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pokémon with you before making this order?
So sorry to keep you waiting! Here's your Village Sub Combo!
It's ready and fresh from the oven! Thank you so much for coming just when everything is at its most delicious! This is free of charge, so please feel free to take it!
I'm very sorry. The bread has become ever so slightly dried out, but the flavor itself is still passable.
I'm really quite sorry, but we're completely sold out today. Please do come again another day.
Indeed. We hope to see you again sometime.
Hey! Stay away from that chair! I saw it first!
Well, I lost, so there's nothing I can do but look for another chair somewhere...
The seats here have to be won, OK? The world of food is harsh, too!
If you lose, you can't sit down to eat. The world of food really is harsh.
No matter what, that chair is mine! If you don't get up, I'll force you to get up!
Too bad... I wanted to sit in that chair...
Give up that seat! If you won't, we'll have to battle!
I don't feel like I could beat you... There's nothing for me to do but go somewhere else.
I always eat here! If you get in my way, my Fairies will Curse you!
Ahh... My... My chair was defiled...
Hey? Is it Magnemite Croquettes you want? That'll be $[VAR NUM5(0000,002C)].
Magnemite Croquettes are just what they sound like. They're balls of dough that are cooked to look like Magnemite! They're a cheap and delicious meal that's all the rage with guys and gals who like Double Battles!!
All right! One order of Magnemite Croquettes coming up! Please take this buzzer with you! That'll be ready in [VAR NUM1(0000)] turn[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s. Sorry, friend, but would you have a seat and wait?
Enough with the jokes! That's not enough money, is it?
Sorry, buddy, but if you wanna eat Magnemite Croquettes, you're gonna need [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pokémon!
Hey, thanks for waiting! Here are those Magnemite Croquettes.
Nice timing, friend! They're still pipin' hot right now! I sure am glad you get to eat 'em while they're hot! Just for you, this is on the house!
Well, it might have gone a bit cold.
Sorry! We're already all sold out today! Come on back tomorrow!
Huh? Is that so?! All right then. See you next time!
...The one to sit there will be me. If you're going to get in my way, make ready your Poké Balls!
Fine. I'll let you sit there for now. There's no way I'll lose next time, though!
Hey, hey, hey! Wait up! That seat was made for me!
Hey, you did pretty well for yourself there! I'll go ahead and stop there for now.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?! Don't take my chair away from me!
Oh! What's going on?! My Magnemite Croquettes are getting cold!
I'd appreciate it if you didn't get the wrong idea. It's not like that chair is open for you to sit in it.
I've been defeated... Could you be the one I've heard of?
Oh... You're brave, aren't you?
Hmmph... Fine... Go on and stuff yourself...
Taking a seat from another customer makes everything more delicious!
Just keep that seat warm... I'll be back for it someday...
A Mauville Ramen Bowl... $[VAR NUM5(0000,002C)].
We've got nothin' but ramen... Only people who like Triple Battles come to chow down on it, though.
OK...take this buzzer. It'll be [VAR NUM1(0000)] turns until it's done. Sit and wait quietly...
That's not enough money...
You're gonna need at least [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pokémon if you wanna eat here...
OK...here's your Mauville Ramen Bowl.
No... Wait... You know what's coming... Take this, too...
You beat him, huh? And you even know just when the noodles are done...
You're late, so the noodles got all soggy.
We're all out of soup today. Come back tomorrow if you want some.
All right...
Are you trying to tell me some little wimp like you is encamped at this chair?
Don't you know? Around here... The Fare Prince's...
I was wondering what kind of Trainer could have taken out my bro, but you don't look like you're all that!
No... You're just like him... I shouldn't have taken you lightly just 'cause you're just a kid, though.
At last, luck is on my side! That chair...that piping-hot Mauville Ramen Bowl... All of it...ALL of it is mine!
This is no good! Hurry up and get me another chair before my noodles get soggy!
My uncle let me have his Pokémon just for today! There's no way I'll lose! Today is the day I make that chair mine!
Even...my uncle's...Pokémon... Just...who...exactly...are you?!
I can't go all out against a kid. Can't you just lose and run along somewhere?
That strength... Could you be the one I've heard about?!
I'm prepared.
The boss didn't say anything about this! Just who in the world are you?
Hmmph... So you're my opponent... All right... I've got no complaints.
Hmmph! To think that I would throw my hands up in defeat. You've got my respect.
I knew you'd win your way through. From when we first met, I had a feeling that someday we'd end up meeting here. But... Your sitting in that chair is a sin that shall not be forgiven. That chair was made only for the royalty of the Mauville Food Court. That's right, it's a chair made for me, the Fare Prince. Well then, it's about time for you to behold the power of the prince. The Trainer or the noodles... Which will get soggy first?!
All right! Get your rear out of that chair!
Ha...hahahaha...
The royal throne...and that chair... I will take them both for myself!
Hunh... I can't give up just yet... May we meet again someday...

These sandwiches from Unova are everything I had hoped for! My Pokémon and I are totally satisfied!
The sourness of the Berries and the light and fluffy bun are playing a harmony on top of my tongue.
All right! I got to sit down today! I'm so glad I borrowed my dad's Pokémon!
Are you a Trainer? They say there's a prince here!
Nom-nom-nom... Yummy!
These Berries are a bit bitter. I'll have my Pokémon eat them.
The name of this place is Mauville Food Court. Trainers are always battling over seats to sit and eat at, though, so it's also known as the Battle Food Court.
Won't this buzzer hurry up and buzz? I want to make it to my meal without anybody getting in my way...
Oh... It's actually delicious... I can't get enough of this sauce.
Let me tell you something interesting. There's a time when each of these dishes is at its most delicious. If you get it on the right turn, something good will happen.
Can't you get takeout here? I want my Pokémon at home to taste this flavor, too!
Y'all had better hurry up and eat before he comes back...
Slurp... Slu-slurp... Oh, it's good... Slurp... It's seriously good.
One of the Elite Four is named Glacia, right? I've seen her eating ramen here before! She was slurping down her noodles at such an incredible pace that she was dripping with sweat!
Huh?! You're getting in line now?! They're probably already sold out!
I've been in line for nearly three hours. I wonder if I'll be able to eat...
Hey! No cutting in line!
Ahh... My legs are so stiff. I can't believe that even I got tired from this line.
When your dish comes out here, it has a strange metal lid on it, right? It's called a “cloche” and is used at restaurants in the Kalos region. The owner here admires Kalos, so he went to the trouble of importing them to use here.
@s checked the buzzer! “Just [VAR NUM1(0001)] turn[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s until your meal is ready.”
Nom-nom... It's kind of salty today...
All right, what should I eat today?
There's a sign that says “Staff Only” posted here.
It's a stand where you can put away your cloche after eating.
Our first queen... Take good care of the Mauville Food Court. I hope we can meet again somewhere someday! Bye-bye for now!

Welcome to TV Mauville. Many TV programs broadcast in the Hoenn region are filmed and edited in the studios here. Feel free to tour the studios.
Have you activated StreetPass? If not, activate it on your BuzzNav. You can watch news about nearby friends!
Are you touring the studios? Don't touch any of the equipment. It could be dangerous.
Oh! Oh! The notification icon appeared on my BuzzNav! I'll check the latest news!
We're here on a field trip! I need the host of Trend Shoot! My mom asked me to get his autograph.
Do you know how to use the communication button on the PSS? The PSS is one of the apps of the PlayNav. You can use it to get news of faraway friends on the Internet. Think global! That's how the world is going. Otherwise, you won't be able to survive in this tough world. Yep, I'm probably the only one in my age group concerned about it!
I'll be on TV when I grow up! And I'll talk about wonderful items with Pokémon!
Cha tch tch!
Hey! Hello—you over there. Do you know the Hoenn Rangers?
Of course, you don't know. I'm not even surprised. The Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force! It's all heroes we created to promote Hoenn. At least...that was our plan. But around the same time as our heroes debuted, the Contest Spectacular got popular in the Hoenn region, and... Sigh. Nobody paid any attention to our heroes...
If you hit up souvenir shops, I think you can still find action figures or whatever. But they've probably been cleared off the shelves already...
You know about them? Really? That puts the heart back in me!
Hoenn's Local Heroes The Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force! We fight for the peaceful coexistence of Pokémon, nature, and people!
Hoenn's Local Heroes The Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force! It's an action figure of the powerful yet absentminded hero, Mauville Yellow. The number on the price tag is faded by the sun, and you can't tell how much it is.
The shelf is crammed with TV Mauville merchandise.
A poster for the BuzzTV program “Special ☆ Spectaculars” is displayed on the wall.
A poster for the BuzzTV program “Secret Base Crashers!” is displayed on the wall.
A poster for the BuzzTV program “MDU: Mirage Detection Unit” is displayed on the wall.

It's Telemauv, the mascot character of TV Mauville!
The shelf is filled with files entitled “Press Activity Report.”
It's the equipment that edits images and music.
It's a script for Pokémon News!
Oh, it looks so GOOOOOOD! I wanna dig in right this second! Wha—? You want a battle? Now?! OK, it's time to eat or be eaten! Our menu's stocked with dishes too good to miss, and our food court's packed with Trainers too good to pass up! The Mauville Food Court is open for battle EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK!

The revolutionary Inverse-o-matic machine the inventor created can invert type matchups! For example, you know Fire-type moves are super effective against Grass-type Pokémon, right? Not with the Inverse-o-matic! Flip it on, and Fire-type moves become not very effective at all against Grass-type Pokémon! Now try to land as many supereffective hits as you can! Get lots and lots of points!
Mumble mumble mumble... It's very difficult, this shop. Yes, very difficult. I still can't even manage to remember all the type matchups for normal battles, and now...
Hey, you. Kid. You know about the Ability called “Mold Breaker”? It lets you hit an opponent, regardless of its Ability. It's a wicked-useful Ability to have when you just wanna let loose on any opponent.

Then let's begin the Battle Test at once! Please bear in mind that once you start, you'll face five battles without a break. If you're ready for that, please choose the Pokémon you'd like to battle with.
Let the Single Battle Test begin!
Let the Double Battle Test begin!
Next is the second round! Start!
We're still just beginning! Third round...start!
The end is in sight! Fourth round...start!
It all comes down to this! Fifth and final round...start!
Good effort out there. Let's see the results of your Battle Test... Based on your results, you are...
Master Rank! A-a-amazing! How about giving me a few pointers next time, huh?
Elite Rank! Goodness me! You can definitely brag to your friends about that.
Hyper Rank! That is impressive. You must be practicing quite a bit.
Super Rank! You're quite strong, aren't you?
Normal Rank! It seems your abilities are about average.
Novice Rank... Hmm, I see. You could try a bit harder.
Oh... Beginner Rank. Maybe you should brush up on your basics.
Well, last but not least, I'll award you with BP and prizes for your efforts on the test!
@s received [VAR NUM2(0001)] BP!
O-oh, you'd like to try? I'm sorry... It's probably still too early for you to try any of the Battle Tests here. Please come back after you finish your journey and grow stronger.

In a Battle Test, you battle against five Trainers in a row without pause. I will evaluate your skill at Pokémon battling based on those five battles. You can receive Battle Points—or BP for short—based on how you battle! And I've also arranged for prizes to be awarded based on your performance!
In this Battle Institute, we like to have an even playing field, so all Pokémon battle at Lv. 50. Select three Pokémon for a Single Battle Test and four Pokémon for the Double Battle Test. All of your Pokémon and all of the items they hold must be different. No duplicates allowed!
Download Tests are special Battle Tests that can be downloaded during certain times via the Internet or from a special-event location. There are two connections you can use: a local connection or an Internet connection. Please select the appropriate connection based on the environment that you are in.
We hope to see you again!
Even when I make full use of everything I learned, Battle Tests are still difficult!
To take a Battle Test, you need to be stronger than the Champion... Battle Tests are taking place in many different regions... That means there are many Trainers who are stronger than Champions. I'm curious about how strong Hoenn Trainers are compared to Trainers in other regions.
Howdy there, Trainer. Please wait!
You're a skilled Trainer, ain'tcha? No need to say nothin'. Just take this here gift!
It's a Vs. Recorder! You can record battles with friends or battles at facilities. It's a purty high-tech device!
It's a thang that costs tens of thousands, but I don't need anythan' in return from you. If word gets 'round that a strong Trainer like you uses a Vs. Recorder, I'll get more customers who want to buy 'em. That's my plan.
In Mauville, there are as many as three places where your Pokémon can learn moves. If you find a rare Pokémon, you may want to seek out these places.

What in tarnation is this, then? Oh, I reckon you're another one fixin' for a Rotation Battle?
Your elevator don't go all the way to the top, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]songirl? Can't have no Rotation Battle without three Pokémon at least.
Naw... I don't want ary of no battlin'... Just can't work up no hunger for it, nohow. And you look like you ain't much to reckon with anyway. Get on with you, now!
Aw, come on, Gran! They bothered to come all the way out here. And a little battling does a body good!
Consarn it... Well, I suppose I might could... Can't see what all the commotion's about, but since it's my own kin doing the asking...
Oh, of all things... We done? I'm plumb tuckered out now...
Thanks for showing Gran a good time. Why don't you take this for your trouble?
Consarn it. I'm feeling weak as all get-out. You go and get yourself on home now, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]songirl.
It's like this. My old granny used to be a fearsome Trainer. She was known as the Rotation Fiend! But ever since we lost Granddad, she's lost that old spark of hers... Now all the neighborhood scamps are calling her the Rotation Frump.
Gow! Gow-ow!
Oh, are you going to battle with Mom? What a sweet young Trainer you are! I know she'll enjoy it to bits, but of course she is getting up in years... She really can't manage more than one battle a day. You understand, don't you?

Hi! Welcome to Crooner's Café!
Songs change with the times, and the times change with songs... I wonder what kind of melody is popular now.
Please take this. You live in this time. I'm curious about what kinds of songs you sing.
Lalala... Lalala... ♪
Music is a mysterious thing. Just listening to a song I used to hear transports me back to that time.
I'm going to mesmerize people everywhere with my guitar and this Pokémon's voice.
Whiswhis...
Do you want to know a great spot in Mauville? It's Pokémon Reflexology Services, obviously. You know, everybody wants their Pokémon to be friendly toward them, right?
They say if you blend rare Berries, you'll get great Pokéblocks... However... What are rare Berries? Who in the world decides that? For instance, Cornn Berries and Magost Berries are hard to get... So if I use those, can I get great Pokéblocks?

Well, well, what have we here? A most energetic customer! Me? You may call me Rydel. I'm the owner of this cycle shop.
Your running shoes... They're awfully filthy. Did you come from far away?
Is that right? Then I guess you have no need for any of my Bikes.
Hm, hm... You're saying you came all the way from Littleroot? My goodness! That's ridiculously far! If you had one of my Bikes, you could go anywhere easily while feeling the gentle caress of the wind! I'll tell you what! I'll give you a Bike! Oh, wait a second! I forgot to tell you that there are two kinds of Bikes! They are the Mach Bike and the Acro Bike! Mach Bikes are for cyclists who want to feel the wild, blowing wind as they ride! Acro Bikes are for those who prefer a technical ride! I'm a real sweetheart, so you can have whichever one you like! Which one will you choose?

Oh, it's you! I've been waiting for you! Many people have come to my shop, saying they saw you riding a Rydel's Bike here and there and they want to buy a Bike, too. Thanks to you, my business is thriving! As a token of my appreciation, I'll give you another Bike!
May the wind always be at your back on your adventure!
I'm learning about Bikes while I work here. If you need advice on how to ride your Bike, there are a couple of handbooks in the back.
It's a handbook on the Mach Bike. Which page do you want to read?
A Bike moves in the direction that the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad is pressed. To stop, release the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad. The Bike will slow down and stop. Do you want to read a different page?
A Mach Bike is speedy, but it can't stop very quickly, and that makes it a little tricky to stop the Bike. Release the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad shortly before the place where you want to stop, and the Bike will stop at the place you want. Do you want to read a different page?
There are sandy slopes throughout the Hoenn region. The loose, crumbly sand makes it impossible to climb normally. But if you have a Mach Bike, you can zip up a sandy slope. Do you want to read a different page?

Tip on braking
Sandy slopes
Quit
It's a handbook on the Acro Bike. Which page do you want to read?
Press the B Button while riding, and the front wheel lifts up. You can zip around with the front wheel up using the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad. This technique is called a wheelie. Do you want to read a different page?
Keep the B Button pressed, and your Bike can hop on the spot. This technique is called a bunny hop. Zip around while bunny hopping, and you can jump over certain ledges by hopping across at stepping stones. Do you want to read a different page?
Press the B Button and the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad at the same time to jump. Press the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad to the side to jump sideways, or press backward to make the Bike change directions while jumping. At a place where narrow paths run side by side, use this technique to pass them. Do you want to read a different page?

I think there used to be a strange man in this Pokémon Center... But I can't remember.
Hi! Were you surprised by the size of Mauville City? After all, this is the biggest city in Hoenn!
If you can't make full use of O-Powers, you're not a true ace! I'm using them again and again and leveling up O-Powers...and myself!

My name is Giddy! I have a scintillating story for you! Would you like to hear my story?
Oh... You've deflated me...
When you see the setting sun, does it make you want to go home?
Also, I was thinking...
What's the bottom of the sea like? Just once I would so love to go!
I bought crayons with 120 colors! Don't you think that's nice?
Lying back in the green grass... Oh, it's so, so nice!
Wouldn't it be nice if we could float away on a cloud of bubbles?
When you write something on a sandy beach, it will be washed away. That makes me sad.
That's about it, I think...
Thank you for listening! To show my appreciation, I'll share my O-Power with you!
@s received an O-Power!
You can now use [VAR OPOWER(0000)]!
O-Powers are mysterious powers. You can use them from the PSS. They make Pokémon stronger, increase prize money, and more. They're super useful! You can use them on your friends, too. Being able to help your friends... It's wonderful, isn't it?
Well, I'm going home now. If you like, visit me sometime. I live in Mauville Hills.
Oh, you might be able to meet my friends here, too.
Hey, yo! They call me the Hipster. I'll teach you what's hip and happening.
Oh... That's too bad...

Okeydokey. Young'uns like you are blown away by my funky words! Yeah, yeah. That's what it is! Everybody digs me so much that it's almost embarrassing!
Huh? What does it mean? Well... Ask your grandpa or grandma, OK? Anyhoo, the way you're listening is outta sight! It has me even more psyched! I'll give you an O-Power! Here we go!
Next time, I'll teach you even more totally awesome trendy words!
It's time to say good-bye! So...later. Will you do me a solid and tell the other men hi for me?
Hi, I'm the Bard. Would you like to hear my song?
Oh... You've left me feeling the blues...
♪ Sister eats sweets. Voracious and drooling.
How do you like my song? But I'm none too happy about the lyrics. Thank you for listening to the unfinished song. Please take this as an apology.
♪ Dude sees lady. Happy and twirling.
How do you like my song? The lyrics are great, aren't they? Thank you for listening to such a wonderful song. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
The Hoenn region may be big, but I think I'm the only one who can sing this well.
Oh, what a moving song... I feel really great! I should go home and let the others hear my song. If you like, visit us in Mauville Hills.

You don't want anything? I feel unwanted...
You don't have [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)]!
OK, so we'll trade my [VAR sTRBAG(0000)] for your [VAR ITEM2(0001)].
Good, we'll trade! Please decorate your Secret Base with it!
And, and, I'll give you this, too!
I'll stock up more items, so let's trade again, OK?
Thank you. I was able to trade with you, so I should get going. See you. Decorate your base with a lot of items!
I think my friend will come here soon... He likes strong Trainers.
I'm the Storyteller. I'll tell you tales of legendary Trainers. Will you hear my tale?
Oh... I feel stifled...
This is a tale of a Trainer named @s...
This Trainer saved the game [VAR NUM8(0001,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s. A more cautious Trainer than @s will never be found!
Furthermore, @s...
This Trainer battled [VAR NUM8(0002,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0002,0100)]s. @s must be a Trainer who can never refuse a chance to battle!
This Trainer healed Pokémon [VAR NUM8(0003,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0003,0100)]s at home! No one could be more of a homebody than @s.
This Trainer rode the Cable Car [VAR NUM8(0004,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0004,0100)]s! @s must be a busy Trainer who's up and down all the time!
This Trainer hatched [VAR NUM8(0005,002C)] Pokémon from Eggs! @s is a legendary warmer of Eggs!
This Trainer used h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Dowsing Machine [VAR NUM8(0006,002C)] time[VAR NUMBRNCH(0006,0100)]s. @s must love to find hidden items.
Seriously, the Trainer @s's legend is so epic that I talked too much! What? You're the one and only @s?! Wow! I met the legendary Trainer! As a keepsake, please accept this power.
Hmmm. Entering the Hall of Fame is not far fetched for a Trainer like you!
I'm the Storyteller. Wow! The legendary Trainer @s finally entered the Hall of Fame! Now that I've seen the climax of your legend, I can go home in peace. See you!
Oh, if you like, please come to my house in Mauville Hills.

Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be @s?
Wattson, the Leader of Mauville Gym, uses Electric-type Pokémon. If you challenge him with Water-type Pokémon, he'll zap them! Bzz-zzzt! And he's put in switch-controlled electric devices all over his Gym! Eccentric!
Hey, go for it!
Whoa, you're electrifying! You've powered the door open!

Wahahahah! Now, that is amusing!
The plans to reform Mauville are done for now. Making traps for my Gym and battling with young Trainers like you are the things I live for now!
Then I, Wattson, the Leader of Mauville Gym, shall electrify you!
[~ 21]
I was electrified by you. Now, take this Badge!
@s received the Dynamo Badge from Wattson.
With the Dynamo Badge, Pokémon can use the HM Rock Smash outside of battle. One other thing—Pokémon up to Level 40 will obey you now, even if you got 'em from someone else!
All righty then, this here's for you, too! Go on, take it with you!
Volt Switch is a move where your Pokémon attacks the opponent and then rushes back to switch places with a party Pokémon in waiting!
I swell with optimism, seeing a promising young Trainer like you!
Wahahahah! Go forth and endeavor, youngster!

There are items to elevate a Pokémon's stats temporarily. The ones I know about are X Attack and X Defense. You use them in battle. I am pretty sure there are others like them, though...
Whether you choose to use a certain move, or maybe use an item instead... A Trainer's decisions can determine how battles turn out!
Hey, you. Do you like scary rides, you know, like a roller coaster?
...Tsk. You're lame.
...Hey, you're cool. Like, you are totally my BFF. As a proof, or as a token, you know, I'm giving you my favorite TM.
Sky Drop is seriously sick. It totally messes with the inner ear!

Hey, kid, listen to this. I got this here Metronome that was used by a super-famous musician. If you're really desperate, I guess I could let it go for, say, $1,000. How 'bout it?
Thanks, pal. Sure, I coulda given it to you for nothin', but that ain't how the world works, eh? Here's how to use it. Hand it to a Pokémon, an' then battle with the same move over and over. It'll get stronger an' stronger. Just keep chippin' away.
I shoulda said... That super-famous musician I mentioned? Me. I'm just too popular for my own good lately. I'm not an idol or anything, but I gotta dress like this whenever I leave the house or I get clobbered by fans and paparazzi! Gwahahaheh!
Huh? You don't really need it? But it belonged to a famous musician...
Hey! You trying to shortchange me, punk? I'll wait, but ya better go get some money!
Wait a sec... Here, you've got boatloads of Metronomes already, don't you?! What are you, some kinda Metronome maniac?
...Hey, squirt. You like Pokémon?
...You REALLY like 'em?
...Would you even say you love 'em?
...You'd REALLY say you love 'em?
...Then I'll give you this. Here, take it.
...See, I like Pokémon.
...Tch!
It looks like a real Pokémon, but in fact, it is a fantastically realistic model. It has a note stuck on it that says, “The Rhyhorn Rider is out of order.”
Why would anyone ride on this kinda thing when we've got real Pokémon to ride on?
I used to ditch class to come here when I was a student. But I can't get away with that now that I'm a working man. Sigh...
Gazing at the vastness of the sky, watching the clouds flow... I imagine soaring through the sky on the back of a Pokémon...
Lo! Lo! Lo!
Young'un... Take a good look at that...
Och, but Taillow is a lucky one... Way up high...with the touch of the wind ruffling its feathers...
Young'un... Take a good look at that...
What could have gotten into our Winona? Standing there, way up high, feeling the wind in her hair...
I feel like a new woman after baskin' awhile in the sunlight—just like a Grass-type Pokémon!
I feel like a new woman after baskin' awhile in the sunlight—just like a Grass-type Pokémon! I reckon I can say that 'cause I'm of an age where I've given up worrying about spots or wrinkles or such.
I'm an old busybody. What of it! I'm not shy of telling you to be nice to folks! Now then, whippersnapper, get on that PSS and start handing out O-Powers! Make others happy and you'll find your own happiness, right enough.

I used to work at Sea Mauville, ages and ages ago. But I still remember it like it was yesterday... One of the fellers working under me—can't even recall his name no more—but I can't forget him... That careless fool, aye, he made a real hash of things and I had to let him go. Signed the slip myself. Not long after he left, though, a letter came for 'im. It musta been from someone in his family, judging by the name in the return address. I imagine they musta been worrying about him, working out there on the platform alone and so far away. But the postmark, see... It was from long after he'd been let go. I guess his family never knew the truth of what happened. I guess he could never bear to tell the truth of it all... It's a memory that still makes my old heart ache.
I was born and raised in Sinnoh, while my boy lives off in Kanto. My grandson is a designer in Kalos. My great-grandson is off dreaming in Unova. Our family is scattered all over the place! But I don't feel too lonely as long as I've got this little fella by my side.
Sh-sh-sh-sh-shu.
OK! Hand, please!
A mighty fine Nugget! All yours now.
Hope it pans out for you!
There's nothing funny about Nuggets.
Eh? Seriously, ma'am? Ya gonna treat me to dinner?
I told youse I would, eh? Ya managed to become an Ace Trainer, doll. We gotta celebrate somethin' like dat. Pile up as many o' dem Village Sub Combos or Magnemite Croquettes as ya want.
Thanks, ma'am! I'mma take you up on that!
Yeah, kid. You do dat. But dis'll be our farewell meal, y'unnerstand? Youse can't keep hangin' out wit' a hood like me— not even one with a fab do like mine. Not wit' you bein' an Ace Trainer an' all.
M-ma'am...
Bawoh! Bawoh!
Hey! Wait for me-e-e-e-e-e!
I'm getting to be an age when movin' me auld bones ain't so easy as it used to be. That's why I let wee Poochyena chase after me grandson instead o' taking it on walks.
Contest Spectaculars... Maybe I could enter one. How do you feel about that, Minun? Positive? Negative?
Chirrrirrr!
See there? Take a good look... Raw talent standing before me... Full of fear, yet shining brightly... They could be the next big stars in the contest circuit... Indeed... ...Hmm?!
Oho... Looks like you have quite a bit of promise yourself. I must push you to participate in the Contest Spectaculars as well!

It's an intercom. Would you like to press the button?
...There's no reply.
This is not good. Excuse me. I'm monitoring the hall with my video intercom. If you keep standing there, I'll have trouble seeing the hall.
What do you want? ...Ah, are you my fan? Sorry, but it's not cool of you to invade my privacy like this. Even without you bothering me, I'm already hearing applause from nowhere every time I play the piano, which really scares me.
Who are you? ...Ah, I see. You're his fan, too. Trying to barge into his apartment like that... You don't even deserve to be called a fan... Besides, a passion of that level is no match for my devotion toward him...
Oh, @s. Please come in. It's open.
...Oh, may I help you? I don't really need anything.
No one is here! No one is in this unit!
...
Yo! How many months do you think you haven't paid for? If you don't pay what you owe, I'll take everything you have, including your Pokémon!
No one is here! No one is in this unit!
Oh, no one is there... Then it can't be helped... What? You're there, talking! Don't give me that!
Oops...
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
You pretended not to be in last month and the month before that! You and me need to have a long talk. Let's go inside.
Sniffle...
Yo! You're a Trainer, aren't ya? Then take this.
I got it as security for a loan from a fool who doesn't pay what he owes. A Pokémon would be miserable if it bonded with such a fool and Mega Evolved.
By the way, do you have a Lopunny? I don't know if there are any in Hoenn, but they're very cute Pokémon. They're especially cute in Pokémon-Amie. Take this as impetus to catch one!
Owning a home was my dream. The dream turned into a nightmare called a mortgage...
I realized this after living with my Skitty. My place is too big for the two of us, and we feel lonely.
Mwut?
Hey, what are you staring at me for? I have to wait here for Genesect... Oops, forget what I just said!
Hey, that Pokémon you have... It's Genesect, isn't it? Shhhh! Don't worry! You must be the one to give these to, eh? Say nothing. Just take them.
Douse Drive... Shock Drive... Burn Drive... and Chill Drive! Just between you and me, these are some really rare items. They come from the Unova region through some shady market, you know? Let Genesect hold one of these and... Oh, you already know that, right?
Hey, it's you! You know what they say? That 300 million years ago, Genesect ruled the world! Imagine if we suddenly went back in time... I'd feel lonely and homesick...and scared!
Oh, you're such a smooth talker, eh? ♪ Don't tease an old woman like me. ♪ Well, I have to admit that I'd participate in the Contest Spectacular if I were 10 years younger.
My lady, don't say such things! Your beauty has an ageless quality! Look at me—I'm still on the active list. My Pokémon and I love to go out and dig for Secret Bases!

When I was a kid, there was nothing around here. It was a very boring rural town. But one day, I heard that Wattson would start redeveloping this place modeled on a place called Lumiose. When I heard that, a lightbulb went on in my head, and I started buying up land around here. As a result, I'm now the owner of Mauville Hills. I can live very comfortably on the rental income.

Uncle, I'm begging you!
I want to challenge this Gym to see how much stronger I've become!
Please! You'll let me, won't you?
Now hold on, Wally...
It's certainly true that you've grown quite a lot stronger alongside your Pokémon. But don't you think that jumping right into challenging a Gym might be pushing it?
I'm not pushing it! If it's me and my Ralts, we can beat anyone!
Ah! @s!
Ralts and I have gotten a lot stronger since we first met. Growing together!
I want to prove that to you and my uncle both, @s.
Please...help me once more... And have a battle with me!
But if you won't battle against me, @s... I don't think my uncle will believe that I've really gotten stronger.
Young man... Your name is @s, isn't it?
Young lady... Your name is @s, isn't it?
I do apologize for asking, but do you think you could battle Wally just this once? For his own sake? It doesn't seem like he'll listen to reason the way he is now...
@s, please! Battle with me!
Thank you, @s. OK. Here we go!
We're going to win this, Ralts! We have to!
[~ 18]
Uncle... I'll go back to Verdanturf...
@s, thank you... Being a Trainer is tough, isn't it?
It's not enough just to battle with your Pokémon. I can't become a true Trainer like that... Not really...
Wally, there's no need to get so down on yourself. Why, what's keeping you from becoming stronger? Nothing is! All you need to do is keep growing.
...
Come on, let's go home. Everyone's waiting for you.
...Yes, Uncle.
@s...
I... I'm definitely... I'm going to get stronger. Much, much stronger!
I feel like I learned a lot from just one Pokémon battle with you... About my own limits...and Ralts's...
So...um... That's why... @s... If it's all right... Could I...
Could I call you...my r-riv—
Ah, never mind! S-sorry! It was nothing! Please forget about it!
Guh...good-bye!
It just dawned on me that you must be the young man who kept an eye out for Wally when he caught his Pokémon.
It just dawned on me that you must be the young lady who kept an eye out for Wally when he caught his Pokémon.
So it's you we have to thank for Wally becoming so positive about the future. Thank you.
...Ah, here! Take this. I want you to have it, as a bit of a thank-you.
Even if there are obstacles in your path, I think you'll be able to break through them. Especially if you use Rock Smash there!
We should head back now, but... If you ever have the time, I'd love it if you'd stop by our home in Verdanturf. I'm sure Wally would enjoy it, too. We'll look forward to seeing you!

Hi, have you been checking out BuzzNav?
Where are we supposed to be, um... Where are we going, again?

Hi there. Welcome! This is a specialty mirror store. Basically, we deal in mirrors and mirrors alone. We only exhibit and sell mirrors my husband collects from who knows where. So we don't have very many for sale. This mirror, by the way, is said to be used with Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus. I have no idea if that's true.
Hi, there. Welcome! Wait a sec! Don't tell me that you are with [VAR PKNAME(0000)]! Oh, my! That's awesome! This mirror is called Reveal Glass and it's said to be for [VAR PKNAME(0000)]! You can have it. Feel free to use it! But don't tell my husband about it, okay?
Have you tried the mirror I gave you yet? I feel a bit bad for my husband, but items are useless unless you use them, right? Tee hee! Trainer, I'm cheering for you!
Welcome, young one. Have you ever heard of “reflexology”? This is where Pokémon can receive a massage treatment. Would you like me to give your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] a treatment?
Sure enough. If you change your mind, I'll be here!
OK, then! Guess I'll get started on that massage!
[~ 71]
That's it. I'm all done here! The massage made your Pokémon much more friendly toward you, it seems!

Mauville is a great city for Bikers! There are plenty of places to park Bikes, and Cycling Road is just around the corner!
Hanging around and doing nothing is, like, the best leisure activity in all Hoenn.
I'm the eldest of four sisters. Route 117 is down this corridor to the west. There is a day-care center for Pokémon.
I'm the second eldest of four sisters. Route 118 is down this corridor to the east. You'll need a Pokémon that has learned Surf.
I'm third eldest of four sisters. Route 111 is down this corridor to the north. If you want to go to Mt. Chimney, you'll need to take this route.
I'm the youngest of four sisters. Route 110 is down that corridor to the south. It's a unique route where you'll find Cycling Road and the Trick House.
I know that the second floor here is used for apartments, but I have no idea how to get there. Normally, you'd need to know one of the people who live there to get in...

No, thank you! I want to challenge the Gym right away!
What?
Let me see... I'm pretty sure the Gym is...
Yup! Straight ahead this way! Just through the inner courtyard!
What? Hey! Wait!
Wally?!
It's the ticket vending machine for parking Bikes!
Phew... It's actually pretty far, isn't it? All the way here to Mauville...
So that must be Route 118 ahead... I wonder what kind of Pokémon I'll meet there. I can't wait to find out!
I'll see you later, @s! I'm going straight to Route 118! Let's definitely have a battle next time we meet! It's a promise, OK? And you can't break a promise!

Oh, @s, eh? You got here just in time to give me a hand and take a look at this.
This is Square Tower, an attraction here in Mauville City. It's not just for decoration, though. It has a purpose. It's monitoring how things are going in a place near here called New Mauville. To put it simply, it's a watchtower. The light's shining brightly now, see? It's warning us that something out of the ordinary may be going on in New Mauville.
I've got something to ask of you, @s. If we're going to keep standing around talking, could I get you to come to my place? I've got an apartment on the second floor at Mauville Hills. I'll let the security guy know, so how about you grab the elevator on the first floor? I sure am sorry to put you out like this, @s, but please do come.
Square Tower This monument was built to commemorate the friendship between Mauville City and Lumiose City in the Kalos region.
I got all fired up in the Pokémon battle and got really hungry, honey!
Me, too, darling. First, I want to get a Mauville Ramen Bowl.
Boogoogoo.
The second floor here is a high-class apartment complex called Mauville Hills.
My hometown is Castelia City. It's as big as this city.
The world is big, isn't it? You, come to Castelia someday.
It's the Square Tower!
It's the Square Tower! The light of the tower is shining brightly!
Tallo!
Hehehe... The view from here. Only tenants can enjoy this privilege...
Mauville City, Sea Mauville on Route 108, and New Mauville... All of them have “Mauville” in their names, right? That's because some corporate group held all the legal rights on every one of them. But the group went under, and everything except the name “Mauville” disappeared into thin air.
When I get up in the morning, my family brings me here. I chitchat with my tea-loving friends, who are also brought here by their families. Then I eat the lunch my family prepared for me. My family picks me up when the sun sets. This is my every day, my lifestyle. I have nothing to complain about.
Goo.
All right, made it to Mauville City.
We've arrived in Mauville City!

Up ahead here is Mt. Chimney, huh? That's the place those nut jobs at Meteor Falls were talking about going to. Be careful, @s. It might get dangerous around here.

My Pokémon has a Hasty Nature. And it has a higher Speed stat than my other Pokémon. Maybe Nature has something to do with how stats grow?
You'll need a Contest Pass if you want to enter a contest. I got mine from the famous contest star Lisia!

A journey to the bottom of the sea... I wonder what it'd be like? I'd love to go deep underwater like that some day.
I wanted to go with Captain Stern on the ocean-floor exploration. But the sub's too small for me. If I squeezed in, there wouldn't be any room for the captain...
Those thugs... They're the same lot who tried to take the Devon Parts at the museum...
Hmph...
So you have bothered to chase me, Maxie, all the way here from Mt. Pyre... Hohoho. You have earned my respect for the persistence you have shown.
However... None can stop us now. All that remains is to retrofit this submarine and force our way into the Seafloor Cavern, where the great Pokémon sleeps... Our plans to propel humanity to its ultimate heights have entered their final stage.
If you wish to prolong your futile struggle, I will not deny your right to try. Our hideout lies in Lilycove City. Follow us to our very door if you feel that justice demands it. And now I must be going. Tabitha!
We are in accord, Leader Maxie... You Grunts, there!
Until our Leader and I, your Admin, have made our escape in the submarine, stay here and buy us some time!
Yessir!
Yessir!
This way, Leader Maxie... We should make haste.
Let us go.
Mission complete! Let's head for the hideout and join the project to modify the submarine!
Yes! I can't wait to see the progress on the submarine.
Impossible! You actually followed us all the way from Mt. Pyre?
Grah-hah! You got me! I bow to your persistence and love of justice! Bwaha! Bwahahahahah!
It's a pity, so it is, but we're well past the time when you and your best efforts could turn the tide. We'll add a few last touches to this submarine, and we'll be all set to bust open the Seafloor Cavern where that great Pokémon is sleeping. Our plans to return everything to the beginning... They're as good as complete!
But I know you gotta do what you gotta do, scamp. I'm not gonna tell ya to quit chasing us... Follow us all the way to our hideout in Lilycove, if that's what your honor demands. Now then... Shelly?
...Got it.
You guys! Keep that spoiled brat busy until the submarine takes off.
Aye aye!
Ma'am!
Let's go. Archie...
Got it. We'll see you there, then! My little scamp adversary! Grahahaha! Bwahahahahahahah!
Mission complete! I'm going to check out the modified sub in our hideout!
I'm psyched to see all the modding on the sub!
M-modding?
Those criminals... What are they planning to do with my Submarine Explorer 1?
They can't be!
They can't be after the super-ancient Pokémon that slumbers at the bottom of the sea...
@s... I'm sorry, but...
@s... I'm sorry, but...
My stolen submarine... It could bring an unimaginable disaster upon the world... Someone has to get to their hideout in Lilycove and stop them! But I've got no chance alone!
... So that's what they've done. They've defaced my precious submarine, and now they're aiming for the Seafloor Cavern...
There's no way a normal human would be able to catch that sub. Although it would be a different story if you could teach a Pokémon to swim underwater using Dive...
We're building a new ship with the help of Mr. Briney, renowned as the best sailor in the Hoenn region. We'll let you know when she's ready to launch!
We've finally completed our new ferry, the S.S. Tidal! She's anchored here in the harbor. Do give her a look, eh?
Ho! That device you have there is the Scanner from Sea Mauville! That could make our expeditions really take off! Would you do me a favor and let me take that Scanner off your hands?
[~ 53]
[~ 54]
[~ 55]
You drive a hard bargain. Let me know if you reconsider.
[~ 57]
[~ 58]
[~ 59]
@s handed the Scanner to Captain Stern.
Yes! Thanks. This will help our research a lot! Take this bell as a token of my appreciation for your generosity.
That bell figures in old legends from the Johto region. It's pretty nice to have. When I was working on Sea Mauville, I had a lad working under me who was from those parts, and he gave me that. If I remember rightly, his family passed down some special dance style. But it was only for the girls, so as a lad he came here looking for work...
He always kept that bell on his person, but sometimes when we were up top there at Sea Mauville that bell would ring, and it would almost seem to glow. It sure was mysterious, all right. I've held onto it all these years, but I'd be happy if it could serve you some use now.
@s, please... May I ask for your help?
@s, please... May I ask for your help?
I can at least get you as far as Lilycove, where their hideout is...
Do you think you and your Pokémon could put a stop to them and save my sub from being used for evil? Please!
Thank you! We'll launch at once!
O-oh... Tell me if you change your mind. There's no one else I can ask...
This is not just for buying time. I'll flatten you!
I was the one who was flattened...
Seems I have no choice... It takes me, a Team Magma Ace Grunt, to take care of you!
But, but... I'm a Team Magma Ace Grunt. How could I have lost?
I can fight like Poseidon even on land!
P-P-Poseidon is not so good at battles on land!
Hmph! What a pathetic man! I'm the 26th-strongest Team Aqua Grunt. Leave this to me!
I'm the 26th-strongest Team Aqua Grunt. But, but...I lost!
A ferry to Lilycove...
Oh! That ticket!
Are you the one who brought a weird ticket?
The place you're trying to go to is a small island in the south end.
Nobody knows what will happen there... I'm so excited that I want to dance a hornpipe!
Hop right on the boat!
I'll be waiting here. Take care out there by yourself, @s. I have faith that you're up to the task!
Welcome back, @s. So you actually managed to find it at Southern Island... The Eon Pokémon!
Well, then... Should we head back to the Gym?

Yes? If you're looking for Stern, that would be me. Ah! Those must be the parts I ordered from Mr. Stone at Devon. Thank you for bringing the case all this way. Now we can prepare for our expedition at last!
Heh heh heh heh... Hold up a moment! We'll be taking those!
Hah hah hah hah... Just a moment! We'll be taking those parts!
Wh-what was that?! Who are you people?!
We're Team Aqua! Our boss wants the parts in that case, so shut your yap and fork it over!
We are Team Magma! Our boss has need of the parts in that case, so relinquish it to us at once!
Awaaaughhh! I got beat by a little brat?
Absurd! I was defeated by this child?
Oh, man, what a disaster... The boss is gonna be furious...
This is quite disastrous. At this rate, I will become the target of the boss's fury!
Hmph! Sniveling wimp! Stand back and watch me, the 27th-strongest member of Team Aqua, take care of this kid!
My, you really are incompetent... I suggest you observe while a future Ace Grunt of Team Magma makes short work of this infant.
They beat the 27th-strongest Grunt in Team Aqua?
How could a future Ace Grunt of Team Magma be defeated?
N-now what? If we don't get that case, we're in for it!
Wh-what should we do now? We must obtain that case at once!
Arrgh! I never thought we'd be stopped by some meddling kid!
Hmph... I would never have posited that a mere child would prove such an obstacle.
What do we have here? I came to see what was taking so long just to steal a few parts, and I find you simps getting beat by this kid?
Now here I was wondering how you could be held up in the simple act of seizing a case. Do I take it you are being stymied by this child?
Heh! That's quite a fierce expression for such a wee little scamp. That face tells me you're not just another mindless Trainer brat.
The name is Archie. The rough-looking lot you see here are members of my team—Team Aqua.
So tell me, child... Do you know that Pokémon, people, and all life in this world depend on the sea for life? That's right. The sea is an irreplaceable treasure for every living thing on this planet.
But with our selfish extravagance, humanity dirties the great ocean, destroying this source of all life... Day by day, we're all destroying our most precious resource!
If we humans suffer from our actions, well, maybe we'll end up getting what we deserve. But what about the Pokémon in our world? The Pokémon that no longer have a place to live because we stole and soiled their seas? The Pokémon that won't have a place to raise their young and watch them grow? We are creating a world in which innocent Pokémon suffer as a result of our actions... And that is something that I can't forgive!
That's why I came to a decision, see? The foolish actions of my fellow humans, the seas we have blighted, nature itself... I will return everything to its unspoiled beginnings!
... Heh! It's not like me to talk so much.
Never mind, little scamp... I'll withdraw for now and leave you be. But understand this... Get in my way again, and you won't walk away unscathed next time.
Remember that, at least!
We're moving out, lads!
Hmm. Though you are but a child, your eyes tell me of your fierce determination. My heart is pounding in my chest... Yes, I think I can see why my lowly Grunts could not stand one minute against you.
I am called Maxie. I stand as the head of Team Magma, a noble organization whose goal is to propel humanity to even greater heights of progress and evolution.
Indeed. And you are one of the young persons who may shape our society's future. Considering that fact, I believe I shall educate you in the ways of the world.
The land... It is the stage upon which humanity stands. The land exists so we humans might continue onward and upward, stepping into the future... For us to continue growing and evolving, humans require a grand stage upon which to stand. A land upon which we can stride forward... A land we can explore...develop...exploit... This is the basis for the growth of all human endeavor.
That is why we, Team Magma, must increase the landmass of this world!
Believe that this will lead to a future of eternal happiness for humanity... And consequently for all life!
Humph. I suppose the concept may still be too difficult for a child to comprehend. Is that the case?
At least I have tried to open your mind. I will take my leave for now. I suggest you take care that you never again stand against Team Magma. I will not be so lenient the next time.
I implore you to remember that.
We are done here.
Young man... Ah, @s, is it? That was quite a tense situation! Thank you for helping me out! Oh, yes, I almost forgot that you brought the parts from Devon!
Young lady... Ah, @s, is it? That was quite a tense situation! Thank you for helping me out! Oh, yes, I almost forgot that you brought the parts from Devon!
@s handed over the Devon Parts to Captain Stern.
This is it! I can't be standing around here! It's finally time for us to set out on our ocean-floor expedition! Thanks for this, and excuse me!
Looking at this model of a ship here reminds me of Mr. Briney on Route 104.
Don't run around inside the museum!
Wow, the submarine's awesome! I want to go for a ride!
“Kanto Water Quality Sample,” the label says. The sea is all connected, but the water seems to differ by region.
“Johto Water Quality Sample,” the label says. Maybe the water's saltiness differs from one region to another...

“Unova Water Quality Sample,” the label says. “Water hardness is a measure of the amount of calcium and magnesium it contains.”

Welcome to the Oceanic Museum. The entrance fee is $50. Would you like to enter?
Enjoy the museum.
Oh? I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough money.
Oh? You're with that group that went in earlier? You're the only one who's late. You'd better go catch up to them!
Please visit again!
Excuse me! Please go through reception!
We, Team Aqua, exist for all Pokémon!
We of Team Magma exist for the good of all people!
We were told to assemble here, so we did, but... The most important person, our boss, isn't here.
We were told to assemble here, so we did, but... Our boss, the linchpin, isn't here.
If I stole the stuff here, would it make me rich?
We might be able to make money by stealing things from here.
I can do bad stuff using my power...
I can put my knowledge to use in nefarious deeds...
If our goon didn't bungle things in Rustboro, we wouldn't be here!
If our member didn't fail in Rustboro, we wouldn't have to come here!
I didn't have $50, so it took a long time to get past the receptionist.
It's a secret that I was stopped at reception because I didn't have $50.
I want to learn about the sea and use that knowledge for battling.
I get all giddy and gooey when I see the sea! For me, Captain Stern is the number-one role model!
The sea is vast without end and infinitely deep... There must be many Pokémon that we don't know about.
I want a sea Pokémon. I think it would feel cool and nice to hug.
Aiyeeeh! What are you doing here? Me? I'm the Team Aqua member you thumped before, remember? Here, take this! You have to forgive me!
Aiyeeeh! What are you doing here? Me? I'm the Team Magma member you thumped before, remember? Here, take this! You have to forgive me!
Aww, darn it! You so screwed up our plans! I was going to steal something to make up for it, but... Just you wait! You'll get yours one day!

A blue fluid is spiraling inside a glass vessel. This is an experiment to create a Whirlpool artificially using wind.
A red ball is bobbing up and down inside a glass vessel. This is an experiment simulating a Waterfall using the ball's buoyancy.
It's a sample of soil from the ocean floor. Over many years, the remains of life-forms settle at the bottom of the sea, making sedimentary layers. Analyzing these layers reveals the ancient past.
It's a sample of beach sand. Stones from mountains are washed down by rivers, where they are chipped and ground down. They are reduced to grains, ending up as beach sand.
Oceanic Mini Fact 1 Why is seawater blue? Light is composed of many colors. When light passes through water, most kinds of light lose color. However, blue light retains its color, making the sea appear blue.
Oceanic Mini Fact 2 Why is the sea salty? Seawater contains dissolved salt in the form of sodium and chlorine ions. These ions leach out of rocks. The concentration of dissolved salt makes the sea salty.
Oceanic Mini Fact 3 Which is bigger? The sea or land? The sea covers about 70 percent of the planet, and the rest is land. The sea is therefore more than twice the size of land.
It's a Fossil with wavy ridges on it. Soil on the ocean floor gets scoured by the tide. The flowing seawater marks the soil with small ridges and valleys. If this soil becomes fossilized, it is called a ripple mark.
A strange machine is rotating under a glass dome. Maybe it's for measuring the depth of something...
A rubber ball is expanding and shrinking. In the sea, the weight of water itself exerts pressure. In shallow water, the pressure is not very heavy. However, in extremely deep water, the pressure can reach even tens of thousands of tons on a small area.

Er-hem! I am the chairman of the Pokémon Fan Club! Being the chairman, I am naturally the most important!
No one could best me when it comes to raising Pokémon. No one! In any contest, my victory is a foregone conclusion!
But that would deprive others of their enjoyment. So I now while away my time examining the Pokémon of others.
It is marvelous to witness how others have raised Pokémon. The contented faces of properly raised Pokémon... The kind and loving gazes of their Trainers... My heart is overwhelmed—there is so much happiness.
Oh my! Excuse me! I seem to have nattered on far too long! Please, do allow me to examine your Pokémon and see how it's grown.
How is your Pokémon growing? Allow me to examine it.
Hmmhm... I see...
Hmmm... It's not bad, but it's not good, either. You, the Trainer, must put more effort into raising this Pokémon! For instance, may I suggest that you give it more Pokéblocks?
[~ 8]
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)], it is growing in a most impressive manner! It is one fine specimen! But! If you let it hold this item, it would become even more attractive! Indeed!
Let a Pokémon hold that Red Scarf. Everyone will recognize the coolness of that Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Blue Scarf. Its beauty will be accentuated much more than now!
Let a Pokémon hold that Pink Scarf. It will draw out the cuteness of the Pokémon some more!
Let a Pokémon hold that Green Scarf. That will enhance the cleverness of the Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Yellow Scarf. It will bolster your Pokémon's toughness!
I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to give you! None at all! After all, you're blessed with the gift of raising Pokémon without resorting to any items!
I love seeing Pokémon that are very friendly toward their Trainers. Pokémon are very sensitive to the feelings of their Trainers. If you treat your Pokémon with love and care, they'll become friendly. When your Pokémon become friendly, please come show me.
Your Pokémon is really friendly toward you. For you, a most compassionate Trainer, this is a gift from the Fan Club!
Pokémon are very sensitive to the feelings of their Trainers. If you treat your Pokémon with love and care, they'll become friendly.
If you keep letting a Pokémon faint in battle, it'll start feeling sorry for itself. Soon, it will become less trusting of its Trainer. In other words, it certainly won't become friendly toward you.
Do Pokémon enjoy having items used on them? Mine acted really happy when I gave it some Protein.
Fnyaaaa.
Trill...
Marimari?
Do you know the Pokémon Furfrou? They are very rare here in Hoenn. But if you have a Furfrou with you, I'll trim it for you for $500.
Oh, dear. You don't seem to have $500.
Oh, dear. You don't have a Furfrou with you today.
All right. Which Furfrou will I trim today?
And what kind of style were you thinking of?
Heart Trim
Star Trim
Diamond Trim
Debutante Trim
Matron Trim
Dandy Trim
La Reine Trim
Kabuki Trim
Pharaoh Trim
Back to natural
Never mind
Then let's start. Please stay calm, Furfrou.
Snip...[WAIT 5] Snippity-snip...[WAIT 5] Snip-snip... Snip!
Thank you for your patience! It's all done. Your Furfrou looks gorgeous!
All right then! First, I'll take $500 from you for the trim.
If you ever wish to try out a new style, come back again!
So you would like to keep the same style and just touch up the ends a bit, is that right?
So you'd like to return your Furfrou to its natural look. Is that right?
Oh dear! I can't style an Egg.
Oh, I am sorry, but... I can't trim any Pokémon but Furfrou.
Oh? But your Furfrou already has its natural look.
It's a portrait of the Pokémon Fan Club's chairman.
It's a portrait of a Pikachu in aristocratic clothes.
It's a photo of a Skitty with an adorable ribbon!
They're pamphlets for joining the Pokémon Fan Club!

Ah-huh... Sea Mauville is a unique place. It's a building, yet it's also a natural preserve. If you seek adventure, you should go there.
I'm happy to hear that. Oh, sorry...need to introduce m'self! I'm Cap'n Salty. I used to work for Sea Mauville, and I'm still emotionally attached to that place. So I've always wanted young people to know how great Sea Mauville is.
Oh, how are you doing? The other day, I bumped into a guy who worked under me at Sea Mauville. He seemed pretty successful in his career now, but he was still apologizing for a mistake he'd made in the past. He said something like, “I'm terribly sorry that I lost the Odd Keystone.” I don't remember it at all, but it made me feel nostalgic and happy.

I guess Captain Stern is probably off at the Oceanic Museum again... Sorry, but could I ask you to find the captain and give the parts to him?
I guess Captain Stern is probably off at the Oceanic Museum again... Sorry, but find the captain and deliver the parts directly to him!
Shipbuilding is an art. A lot of things can't be figured out by calculations on paper. I really could use some advice from a veteran sailor who knows the seas...
Hey! Mr. Briney agreed to join us and lend us his knowledge and expertise. The help of a legendary sailor means the ferry plans are really coming together!
It's finally ready! Our new ferry, the S.S. Tidal, is truly a marvel of technology! But I get the feeling we can make something better yet. You know, there's never an end to technology's onward march.
Ah, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0606)]my ladlassie! It's been too long! Since helping you—well, you got this ol' seadog wanting to sail the seas again! So I decided to help Dock make a ferry! After all, I'll be able to take even more people across the sea in a ferry! But, you know, Dock is really something special. With his knack for technology and my experience of sailin', together we can build one great ship, for certain!

Want to know the trick to battling? If you ask me, it's raising different kinds of Pokémon in a balanced way. It's no good to make just one of your Pokémon strong. If you end up facing a type that it's weak to, it might not stand a chance.
You trade Pokémon with your friends, right? If the Pokémon you trade is holding an item when you send it out, it'll make them twice as happy!
Aha! Pokémon Journal If a Pokémon with the Super Luck Ability holds a Scope Lens, its critical-hit ratio will be further boosted.

Where the water is clean, the fruits of bountiful harvest gather. And where people gather, a market for exchange soon starts. This is how a town is formed.

Yeah! I've waited so long for this! Pokémon Contest Spectacular! I'm going to enter! But before I do, I have to catch some Pokémon!
Whew... I'm just bushed... I hiked over from Mauville City. But, boy, this city's huge. If I'd known that, I would've ridden my Bike here!
Stern, the fellow who built the museum here, also happens to be the leader of an undersea exploration team. So, everyone calls him Captain Stern.
What is that over there? That long line...
When I was a child, I visited the museum often. I used to dream about the mysteries of the sea after seeing the exhibits.
Hey there! Quit pushing! This is a line, can't you see?
Team Aqua has a policy of assembling and dispersing at the operation site.
Team Magma's policy is assembling and dispersing at the operation site!
Our boss... What would he want to do with a museum now?
Our boss is brilliant. But what would he want to do with a museum now?
What is the new scheme? Our boss is scary when he's mad, so I'd better not screw things up...
I wonder what's the new scheme. Our boss is scary when he's mad, so I don't want to make any mistakes...
If there's something we need in the museum, we should take it all!
If there's something we need in the museum, we should take the entire museum by force...
Hey, you there! Don't butt in!
Hey, you there! Don't cut in!
A long line, huh? It reminds me of the times I lined up to buy smash-hit games...
A long line reminds me of the times I lined up to buy very popular games...
Why are we even lining up and paying? We should just march in!
Paying money to enter the museum shows the earnest nature of Team Magma!
The sea is just so vast... Could the sea have been made by the tears shed by Pokémon?
When you sink a man-made object into the sea to make a habitat for Pokémon, it's called an artificial reef! We in Hoenn are well known for our reef. We call it Sea Mauville!

If you want to change your Pokémon's nickname, get the Name Rater to help. He lives in this town.
Any Pokémon you get in a trade, you can't change its nickname. The original Trainer's love for that Pokémon is in the nickname.
[~ 37]
Do you know about the Pokéblock Kit?
I thought so! It's a must-have kit for Trainers who enter Contest Spectaculars!
With a Pokéblock Kit, you can make candies called Pokéblocks. Make great Pokéblocks and give them to Pokémon. Their conditions will get much better!
I was hoping it was Lisia so I could get her autograph. But who's that being interviewed? Isn't that Captain Stern?
What? What was that?
That lady interviewer is so cool and pretty. When I grow up, I'm going to be an international journalist!
What? What? Is that a premonition that something big is going to happen?
Captain Stern says they discovered something at the bottom of the sea. I wonder what it is. What could it be?
What? The announcement just now... Was it about a submarine jack?!
What's going on here? Did the good captain come back with a big fish from the ocean floor?
Captain... He went inside in a rush... I hope everything is OK.
Hey! Are you watching? Am I on TV?
Is somebody going to steal the submarine? Will I be on TV again?
A TV interview! Here! The captain's a celebrity!
Oh no! I've never imagined that there are people who want to jack a submarine!
OK, Captain Stern, a big smile for the camera!
I see, I see. You've had a most invaluable experience...
Yes, indeed. And that is why we intend to move ahead with our expedition.
That's wonderful, Captain Stern! Thank you for taking the time from your busy schedule to talk to us. We hope we can interview you again with news of more discoveries!
Whew... That was my first time being filmed for TV. What a nerve-racking experience!
Oh! It's you again! You're looking well. Glad to see it. We made a huge discovery on our latest expedition to the seafloor. We found an underwater cavern on Route 128—and we think it may be the den of a super-ancient Pokémon long thought to have been extinct.
???: “Ahhh... Ahhh... Testing, testing. One, two, three...OK.” “I hope you're listening out there... Captain Stern!” “We of Team Aqua will now be assuming control of your lovely submarine!” “You'll contribute to our great plan of returning everything to the beginning... I hope you appreciate this great honor!” “Wah...hahahah! Bwahahahahahahahah!”
???: “Hrr-hrrmph. Captain Stern, I presume you can hear me.” “We of Team Magma will now assume control of your famed submarine.” “Take pride in the fact that your invention will serve as a linchpin of the next great step in humanity's development!” “Fufufu... Fuwahahahahaha!”
Do you hear that voice? It's like someone is using a megaphone... But where is it coming from?
It came from the Harbor! Our submarine! They took it!
Young trainer! I'm sorry, but... Please come with me!

Our city's new Gym Leader is a man called Norman. I heard he moved his whole family here from the Johto region.
I battled Norman once, but he was way too strong! Whew! How should I put it... I just really got the feeling that he lives for Pokémon.

Ah, a journey is a wonderful thing! When I was young, I also roamed across the seas and the mountains!

Welcome to the TV Mauville 11th Anniversary Special Presentation: “The 100 Kinds of Training You Should Try in Order to Win Pokémon Battles!” ... Gotta keep moving!
There's a notebook lying open on top of the desk! It looks like someone has written and erased in it over and over again.
There are pins stuck in places in the Kalos region and the Unova region.
It's the Hoenn region Town Map! There are many notes about the Pokémon that inhabit the area surrounding Petalburg City!
It's full of books about raising Pokémon and Pokémon battles! Every book is totally covered in sticky notes!

You... Ah. You're @s, aren't you?
You... Ah. You're @s, aren't you?
Thank you for helping our Wally out back there.
That boy has been sickly since the time he was born, I'm afraid.
That's why we decided to send him to stay with my brother's family in Verdanturf Town for a while.
The air is far cleaner there than it is around these parts.
Oh, you're looking for Wally? I'm sorry, but I'm afraid he's already left.
I wonder where he is right this moment...
I wonder how our Wally is doing...

Has Surf been proving useful? Teach it to your Pokémon if you want to travel across the sea.
What?! You met Wally in Ever Grande City?! Oh, you joker, @s! You really had me going there for a moment! He may be growing stronger, but he'd never make it somewhere so far away all by himself.
What?! You met Wally in Ever Grande City?! Oh, you joker, @s! You really had me going there for a moment! He may be growing stronger, but he'd never make it somewhere so far away all by himself.
Wally was so happy when he told us that he'd caught a Pokémon... It's been ages since I've seen him smile like that.
[~ 18]
Wally has gotten so much healthier... Getting to see him running about freely and having fun with his Pokémon... I'm so glad to see him well, for once...
I'll be leaving, then. Good-bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!
W-wait just a minute! Wally!
That's right! Are you OK? You looked like you were in trouble recently when those strange thugs came around...
Of course! My Pokémon and I are fit for anything!
See, @s got my Key Stone back for me. And Mr. Norman gave me a ticket to a resort that sounds really neat. I can't wait to go and check it out!
My, my... I never dreamed I would one day think that Wally was TOO well...
Yes... But he looks so honestly happy... that I can't help feeling happy, too.
The fact that Wally wasn't hurt was the only silver lining in this incident. What a frightening world we live in. You be careful out there, too.
I can't forgive anyone who would do such a terrible thing to a sweet boy like Wally...
Who in the world would steal my Key Stone...
I'm afraid Wally headed out on another journey, this time clutching the ferry ticket that he got from your father. I'm glad that he has so much energy these days, but being overly energetic brings us its own set of worries...
Wally... I wonder if he's out there somewhere, giving it his all... If you happen to see him, tell him we're thinking of him...

That PC-based Pokémon storage system... Whoever made it must be some kind of scientific wizard!
When I fed my Pokémon an Oran Berry, it regained HP!
There are many types of Pokémon. All types have their strengths and weaknesses against other types. Some battles will be easier or harder based on the types of your Pokémon.
For example, your Treecko is a Grass type. It's strong against Water and Ground types. But it's weak against Fire types.
For example, your Torchic is a Fire type. It's strong against Grass and Bug types. But it's weak against Water types.
For example, your Mudkip is a Water type. It's strong against Fire types. But it's weak against Grass and Electric types.
Hello there, Trainer! You've got a wonderful smile. If you can use the PlayNav on your PokéNav Plus, I recommend that you renew your profile!
Aha! Pokémon Journal Select and drag the move buttons on the status screen to swap the positions of the moves.

Hm... So you did get four Gym Badges.
Then, as I promised, we will have a Pokémon battle.
@s...
It makes me happier than I can really describe. Being able to have a real battle with my own kid like this.
But a battle is a battle!
I will do everything within my power as a Gym Leader to win!
You'd better give it your best shot, too, @s!
[~ 7]
I can't believe it.
I lost to @s?
... ... You've come this far...
That's how it is, then! I will give you this.
@s received the Balance Badge from their dad!
Having that Badge will ensure that Pokémon up to Lv. 60 will obey you, even if you received them in trades.
Pokémon that know the HM move Surf will also be able to travel over water now.
And this is my gift to you, @s. I'm sure you'll be able to use it well.
Retaliate will allow you to take revenge for a fallen team member. Its power will be doubled if you have a Pokémon use it in the very next move right after an ally faints. I hope you and your Pokémon will be diligent enough to use it wisely.
... Sigh.
As the Gym Leader, I can't express how frustrated I am.
But, as a father, it makes me both happy and a little sad. It's odd.
... Come on, @s.
I'll see you on your way. Let's get out of here.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 609

I'm not going to take it easy just because you're our Leader's kid. I'll show you how horrible it is for a Pokémon to take a critical hit!
[~ 1]
Your father really is strong. He's a Trainer worthy of respect. And I sense the same brilliance in you as in your father. I hope you'll stage a terrific battle between father and [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0803)]sondaughter!
The Trainers of Petalburg City have become a lot tougher since your father became Leader.

Our Gym Leader told us to pull out all the stops to beat you. Even if you do happen to be the Leader's own [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0803)]sondaughter!
[~ 1]
The way you handle your Pokémon reminds me of your father's style. Go on through! The Gym Leader—no, your father— is waiting!
It's OK to focus on making your Pokémon stronger. But what truly determines the winner of a battle? It's the feelings Trainers have for their Pokémon.

Just when you think you're going to win, your opponent restores HP... It's such a terrible feeling... I think I'll let you see for yourself!
[~ 1]
I should have expected no less from our Gym Leader's kid. Well... That's not the whole story. A Trainer's skills are the result of effort and work. I lost to you because I didn't put in enough effort. Go on! Next is the One-Hit KO Room!
I'm going to keep training at the Gym. And one day I'll become the Leader!

The higher my Pokémon's Defense, the more reckless I can be with my attacks.
[~ 1]
I think you've taught me a valuable lesson here. Go on! The left door leads to the Strength Room. The right door opens to the One-Hit KO Room. Both of them have Trainers who are offensively skilled.
How's it going? Have you tried using Surf yet?

Ever since you beat our Gym Leader, our training became much more demanding!
[~ 4]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 614
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hee hee hee... This is the Accuracy Room. It's pretty nasty when every attack lands without fail.
[~ 1]
There are even more fearsome Trainers waiting for you ahead. The Defense Room is on the left. The Recovery Room is to the right. Whichever way you go, your Pokémon's Attack power will be on trial.
Do you know what we are trying to achieve as Trainers? We're striving to be completely in sync with our Pokémon.
[~ 4]
[~ 5]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 615

Being able to attack before an opponent... That confers a great advantage in battle, wouldn't you agree?
[~ 1]
Now move on to the next room, where you will find a new challenge awaiting you. At the left is the Zero Reduction Room. The right door leads to the Defense Room.
No matter whom you defeat or who defeats you, you must never shirk training your Pokémon and yourself. That's what it means to be a Gym Leader.

You know, I sure was surprised that you managed to get here by yourself.
Ah... I see. You're making a good start on your team!
Mm-hmm! Then I guess you're going to become a Trainer like me, @s? Now that's something to look forward to!
Um... E-excuse me... I...I'd like to get a Pokémon, please...
Hm? Aren't you... You're Wally, right?
Y-yes... I'm supposed to go stay with my relatives in Verdanturf Town for a while. But I thought I might be lonely by myself, so I wanted to bring a Pokémon with me.
But I've never caught a Pokémon by myself... I'm not sure if I can.
Mm-hmm. I see.
@s! You heard all that, right? You go with Wally, and make sure that he safely catches a Pokémon.
Wally, here. I'll lend you one of my Pokémon.
Wally received Zigzagoon!
Oh, wow... Your Pokémon, sir?
Hmm... I'll give you a Poké Ball, too, so go give it your best!
Wally received a Poké Ball!
Th-thank you, Mr. Norman!
Um...@s? You will... You will come with me, right?
So did it go well?
Yes, it did! Thank you!
Let me give you back your Pokémon, sir.
And you, @s... Thank you so much for coming with me.
It was all thanks to you two that I was able to catch Ralts. My very own Ralts... I will always, always treasure it!
...Oh! I know! It's not much of a thank-you, but...um...@s? Will you let me see your PokéNav Plus for a second?
OK, that and...ummm...there!
Wally updated @s's PokéNav Plus! You can now use the PlayNav features on your PokéNav Plus!
I read in a book how you can use the PlayNav to take care of your Pokémon and train them. And there's even supposed to be this thing called the PSS, where you can meet up with other Trainers and battle friends and more! I've wanted to have my own Pokémon for so long...and do all those kinda things together... So I've had all these kinds of apps installed on my PokéNav Plus for ages! Embarrassing, huh?
I'm going to try my best together with Ralts. You do your best, too, @s!
Oh, but my mom's waiting for me. I've got to get going! I hope we'll meet again, @s! And you, too, Mr. Norman!
Hmm. That boy will be worth keeping an eye on. But for now...
@s! If you want to become strong as a Trainer, listen to my advice.
First head for Rustboro City, which lies beyond this town. There you should challenge the Gym Leader, Roxanne.
After her, go on to the other Pokémon Gyms and defeat their Leaders as well. Collect Badges from them, understand?
Of course, I'm a Gym Leader, too. I'm sure we'll battle one day. But that will only be after you've become stronger, @s.
Hm? Weren't you going to go to the Pokémon Gym in Rustboro?
Sorry, but I don't get pleasure from battling greenhorn Trainers. There's no challenge. I want you to grow much stronger before I would consider taking you on in battle.
Come back when you've got at least, hmm...four Badges! Then I'll take you on, @s.
I see... So, you've beaten the Gym Leader in Rustboro City.
But there are still many Trainers stronger than you, @s.
Across the sea in Dewford Town is a Gym Leader named Brawly. You should go challenge him.
Hm... @s... You've gotten stronger. I can tell by the number of Badges you've earned.

I'm proud as a parent that you've become the Champion, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0803)]sondaughter.
Yo, how's it going, Champ-to-be @s?
The doors in this Gym open when you beat the awaiting Trainers.
Whoops! The doors in this room are already open, so don't attack me! The Trainers of Petalburg Gym use all kinds of items.
The door at the left leads to the Speed Room. The door at the right leads to the Accuracy Room. The room's name will be on the door, so choose carefully.
Once you've chosen the door... Well, hey, go for it!

Hmm? Is that an Eon Ticket you have there? Hm...it's been a good 11 years since I last saw a ticket like this...
The Eon Ticket is awarded to those who have earned the right to tread upon the soil of Southern Island... In short, it is awarded to those who can wield Mega Evolution, thanks to their bonds with their Pokémon.
Hmm. But, @s, you don't seem to have the skill to handle Mega Evolution yet. Continue to journey across the wide lands and sea of Hoenn, and when you do gain the power to use Mega Evolution, come back here. That is when I will teach about just what the Eon Ticket means.
Mm-hmm! That Mega Bracelet that glitters on your wrist there proves that you are capable of using Mega Evolution. That seals it. Come with me, @s!
Your meeting Latias is no less than a miracle.
Your meeting Latios is no less than a miracle.
Don't let such a precious gift go to waste. I hope you'll continue this journey of yours, with just as much zeal for Pokémon as you've shown so far.
Still, you must not think that you have reached your peak as a Trainer. It is only after you reach a certain height that the view opens up, and you see how far the road stretches. I want to see you trying to hone yourself and your skills even further. I'll be behind you, @s.

Even if a Pokémon is weak now, it will grow stronger if you raise it. The most important thing is love! Love for your Pokémon!
Do you use Repels? They keep Pokémon away, so they're useful when you're in a hurry to get somewhere.
Do you have any Antidotes on you? If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP when battling. To make matters worse, the poison won't disappear after the battle, either. I recommend you bring some Antidotes when you set out on an adventure!

Petalburg City Pokémon Gym Leader: Norman A man in pursuit of power!
Petalburg City Where people mingle with nature.
Wally's House
Ah! @s! Mr. Norman!
I haven't seen the two of you in some time. What a coincidence! I just came back to my parents' house to grab something I'd forgotten.
You look like you've been working hard, Wally. It's clear even without a battle.
R-really? You really think so? Hehe... Thank you! That's so nice of you to say!
Ah. @s, isn't it?
Ah. @s, isn't it?
I'm glad to see you here. I'm Wally's father, of course.
As you can see, Wally's health has thoroughly improved.
It's all thanks to you and your father. You two helped Wally catch his first Pokémon that day. It's because of you that he has a partner of his own now. That partner is why he's grown so strong. That's my firm belief. So, I thank you.
Yes, that's it. Sometimes words aren't enough. It would delight me if you'd take this.
If you're cleared to use Surf outside of battle, you'll be able to cross seas with your Pokémon.
@s... Considering how much you and Wally have grown, you should be able to handle what lies beyond the sea on Route 118 now. There are far stronger Pokémon and Trainers waiting for you on Hoenn's east coast. Continue your journey and your adventures there. I know you'll do your best!
Yes, sir! I will do my best to become as strong as @s, sir!
I guess I had better start out, then. I'm off for now, Dad! See you next time!
Um. Come on, @s! Let's go together!
Wally... I look forward to seeing you and your Pokémon grow stronger together.
@s? Well, take care of yourself out there. Don't forget to drop by Littleroot to visit your mother from time to time!
OK! We're off!
Be safe out there!
Learn a lot!
...

I don't know what it is, but...
...Hm?
Seeing my little boy all grown up and going off on his own... As a father, it makes me happy and a little sad...
Hahahah! What a coincidence! I caught myself thinking the same thing.
Hohoho! Is that so?
... But if only... If only my boy keeps growing strong and healthy like that... I wouldn't ask for anything else.
Yes. I know exactly what you mean.
Mr. Norman told us to keep going beyond Route 118, didn't he... Let me check my AreaNav...
Route 118 is the one east of Mauville City, huh?
@s! Since we're both here anyway, let's go to Mauville together! I'm definitely planning on going to check out Route 118 like your dad said!
Not bad... It was a good battle.
Th-thank you, sir!
Come back and challenge me again anytime. I'll be looking forward to seeing you and your Pokémon again when you're a bit stronger.
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! I'm gonna do special training with my Pokémon. Then I'll challenge this Gym again!
Thank you for the battle, Mr. Norman!
Hm?
Why, if it isn't @s!
So you've finished moving in?
I see... Well... I guess we shouldn't stand around out here talking. Do you want to come in for a bit?
We can talk in the Gym.
Tedious... bothersome...child... You should... just be quiet... and give me...the Key Stone!
I'm telling you I don't have it!
I already know... that you can... use...Mega Evolution!
Argh! Are you even listening? I've been telling you— Ah! @s!
...?!
...You.
Aha. ♪ Nice timing...maybe. ♪
I'll be taking... yours first! Give me... the Key Stone!
Huh...
...No! You're always meddling!
If that's...how it is... at Meteor Falls... the Leader's...Key Stone...
Thank you so much, @s... That strange woman suddenly attacked me, demanding that I hand over my Key Stone... The truth is that I couldn't give it to her even if I wanted to. My Key Stone is gone... I left it in the house when I went out, and it just disappeared. What in the world is going on...
If someone like that ever shows up again... I've gotta protect my mom and dad. You be careful, too, @s!
You're such a little pain! Shut up and give me the Key Stone!
I don't have it, I tell you!
Don't play dumb! I already know you can use Mega Evolution!
Argh! Are you even listening? I've been telling you— Ah! @s!
What the?!
You punk!
Hoohahaha! Just in time, aren't you?
I'm gonna take your Key Stone first, you jerk!
Hooaahhh!
You clown! Always gettin' all up in my business!
If it's gonna be like that, I'm off to Meteor Falls.
Thank you so much, @s. That strange man suddenly attacked me, demanding that I hand over my Key Stone. The truth is I couldn't give it to him even if I wanted to. My Key Stone is gone... I left it in the house when I went out, and it just disappeared. What in the world is going on?
If someone like that ever shows up again... I've gotta protect my mom and dad. You be careful, too, @s!
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app rang on your PokéNav Plus!
???: ...'Lo? Hello?
???: ...Is that you, @s?
???: ...Is that you, @s?
Steven: It's me. Steven. Have you been doing well? Steven: Heh... I imagine you must be quite shocked. Steven: This is a communication mode that Devon is still currently developing. It comes installed on every PokéNav Plus. Steven: I thought I would only use it if I needed to contact you urgently... Steven: But it looks as though that time has already come. Steven: I'm sorry to ask this of you, but I need you to come to the Devon Corporation in Rustboro. Steven: There's something I have to talk to you about—in person... Steven: I'll be waiting for you there.
...Kzt!
So we're here. Petalburg City.
@s, you do your best with the Gym. I'm behind you all the way.
See ya!
Well, we made it! The Petalburg City Gym!
Good luck with taking on the Gym Leader, @s. I'm cheering for you!
Later!

Welcome to the Battle Maison. I'm the receptionist.
What would you like to do today?
What would you like to hear about?
This Battle Maison provides various battles with many Trainers. You can choose from the following battle formats: Single, Double, Triple, Rotation, or Multi Battles. You'll keep battling until you lose, and compete based on how many people you can defeat. Please note that if you lose even once, your winning streak will end, and you'll start from zero again. Every time you defeat a Trainer, we'll give you points called BP. You'll earn more BP as you keep winning, so do your best!
Please note the following three points when you battle in the Battle Maison. First, while you participate in battles here, Pokémon at levels higher than 50 will be reduced temporarily to Lv. 50. Second, please note the number of Pokémon you need for a challenge. You need three Pokémon for Single Battles, four Pokémon for Double Battles, six Pokémon for Triple Battles, and four Pokémon for Rotation Battles. For Multi Battles, each Trainer needs two Pokémon. Third and last, all Pokémon and their items should be different. But for Multi Battles, it's OK for two players to have the same Pokémon or item.
We hope to see you again.

When it's you and me, @s, I feel like we can both show off our best sides! Let's do it!
Hmm... We didn't seem to have it together this time... Oh well! We'll have to try harder next time!
When I'm battling with you, @s, I feel like I could beat absolutely anyone! Let's totally do it again sometime!
Ah. Right. That's too bad, but maybe next time!
Let's do this! I'm gonna give it my all, @s! Wait and see!
Oops... Boy, they were tough, huh? Let's try to win next time! I'll try to get stronger, too!
We did it, @s! Your team and mine together won't lose to anyone!
Aw, that's a shame. But I get it... Let's battle together again some other time!
I hope you can bear with me, @s! I'm going to take this chance to study how a Champion fights from right up close!
I'm s-sorry... I guess me and my team just got in your way...
Thank you so much, @s! Me and my Pokémon both gained a lot from being able to fight beside you!
O-oh... That's too bad... I hope you'll ask me again someday...
Bwahahaha! You wanna team up with me? All right! This might be the strongest combo that Hoenn's ever seen!
Bwahahaha! Even with a combo like you and me, looks like when you're gonna lose, you're gonna lose! But I just can't quit Pokémon battling, not as long as it sets my heart racing like this!
Bwahahahaha! Looks like teaming up with you and your team really gave us the chance to run wild out there! Thanks for the good battle, ya little scamp!
So we're going to wrap things up here today? Fair enough. But give me a shout next time you want a little tussle. I'll be waiting!
So you wish for the great Maxie to battle alongside you... Hehehe... My heart trembles in anticipation! This should be a fascinating battle!
So the great Maxie has fallen, even when battling alongside your team... I shall commit this curious phenomenon to memory. It had less than a 1 percent probability of occurring, you know.
Hehehe...hahaha! This result was inevitable the moment the great Maxie joined hands with you! Should another such opportunity occur, I anticipate a similarly beneficial outcome.
All things must inevitably come to an end. But I look forward to the prospect of a new beginning.
I'd be honored. I anticipate that battling together with you will help me realize something new!
It is what it is. We lost the battle, but I was still able to learn something. Thank you.
It is what it is. So it is only natural that our Champion-level combo would win.
I see. So this is the end for us today? I don't believe you gave it all you have in you. The unplumbed depths of your true power are quite frightening. Still, I look forward to battling together again someday.
Scouting the Pike Queen—done. Are there any Trainers who measure up to Scott's expectations?
The upper level is a viewing area for folks like us who don't battle. They sure fleece us for the privilege, but the matches you get to see are the best!
Wh-who are you? The sight of you set my Seviper shivering!
I've been watching the matches from up here, but the Trainers here are rank amateurs to the last. The only ones here who even begin to compare to me in terms of skill and beauty might be those gaudy little girls calling themselves Battle Chatelaines.
Slaaah...
Wha— You want me to restore your Pokémon's health? Honestly, you people! Can ye not see I'm off duty? Do I look like I've got a device to heal ye tucked in my skirt pocket? The Pokémon Center I work at never gives me a day off! This is my first time off in 20 days. Leave me in peace, can ye?
Did you see them? DID YOU?! The stunning Battle Chatelaine sisters! They're here now! Seeing them battle was like Cupid's arrow right to my heart! BAM!
An endless banquet for Trainers who have had their hearts captured by Pokémon battling... For us serious battlers, this place is both the ultimate dream and our worst nightmare.

I heard that this house is a re-creation of a building in the Kalos region and the event that takes place in the building.
Oh! It's you!
You're here, too, huh? I guess when Trainers find out about a facility like this, it gets their blood pumping. This place reeks of hard-driving Trainers.
Who, me? I came to ask that guy Steven to come to the Pokémon League. That guy really goes for it when it comes to the Battle Maison. He's been hanging around here where he can have different battles than in the Pokémon League. Anyway, I came to bring him back, but it looks like he dodged me...
Well, I said what I came to say. I'm going back to Ever Grande. You're going to try your luck at the Battle Maison, too, right? If you see that guy, say hi for me. See you later.
@s!
This monument was built to commemorate you, wasn't it?
That's amazing! You really are Hoenn's top Trainer, @s.
How naive you are...
Um... You are...?
There's no end for battles in the Battle Maison! Unknown strong Trainers like us keep battling, hoping to achieve 100 or even 200 consecutive wins!
That many?!
A battle is like a house of cards! It's like a midsummer night's dream! Records will be broken sooner or later. All we can do is train hard every day!
I see...
Well, I'm going to excuse myself now. You two, try hard!
So there are still other Trainers who are that passionate about Pokémon battles... Wow! I feel like trying harder seeing that. I'm sure I can still become stronger!
I'll see you later then, @s! I'm going off to train some more!
I heard that my muse, Mademoiselle Evelyn, is touring the Hoenn region, so I used everything I had saved and came all the way from Kalos! I won't have the energy to stock shelves unless I see her dainty face!

Ah! @s! So you came, too!
Mr. Norman actually gave me a ticket as well. I just got here a little while ago. So this is the Battle Resort... A tropical paradise that only the lucky few get to visit...
Ahyahya! Very well then, Leader Maxie. The time has come for us to...
...Fight!
Hmph.
Oof! Ow!
Hmm?
I'm s-sorry, ma'am, sir... Running into you like that...
Hummph! Sir?!
...Ma'am?!
...
Hey! I, Tabitha, have only just turned 27! How old do you think I am?! I shall never forgive you!
I'll...make him cry...
Ah...
Leader? Is this that child...
Hmm... Indeed. The hero who crushed Team Aqua's hopes and saved the world.
I had not expected to meet you here.
Are you a friend to that young man who just left? His whole body seemed to hum with his eagerness for battle... He must be quite the Trainer.
It seems that I may get to battle both you and that young man here... Fuhaha! It appears that coming to this island may prove worth the trouble yet!
There has been something on my mind ever since the incident in Sootopolis... In another time, or perhaps another world, one only a fraction of an inch removed from our own, it seems very likely that it would have been us in Team Magma standing against you in that battle... Perhaps we would have been the ones trying to revive Groudon and obtain its terrible power for ourselves...
But of course it is pure fantasy. Talking about other worlds, or alternative realities... It is just a dream for those of us living in the present world. Fuhahaha...
Ah, yes. But now that I've had the good fortune to meet you again, I should give you that thing...
Courtney?
...Yes?
You have to...take care of it...
I look forward to a day when my Pokémon team might face yours in battle. Until that day...
Ahya! And with that, we bid you adios!
You...seem fun. ♪ Target...locked...
Aha. ♪
See you later, Archie. Do it right.
Fight on, bro!
Aye aye! Take care of the crew while I'm away!
[~ 34]
Hyo!
I'm s-sorry, ma'am, sir... Running into you like that...
Ma'am...
Oho?!
Hmm. Interesting.
Wh-what?! It's that brat! No matter how you look at it, I'm a “miss,” not a “ma'am”!
What an honest kid...
Oh!
Huhn?! Is this that kid...
Ahhh, yeah. The scamp of a Trainer who put a stop to Team Magma and that Groudon of theirs.
To think I'd run into you here.
And that little runt there, he's one of your friends? He only passed us by, but I felt a real fire for battle there. He must be some Trainer.
Looks like I'll get to take on the both of you if I keep battling here a while! Bwahahaha! Looks like it won't be a waste that I came all the way out here after all!
I've gotta say...it's been weighing on my mind ever since Sootopolis, but... You know, if we lived in a slightly different world, it might have been me and my crew that you'd had to stop... It's not a stretch to think that we might have tried reviving Kyogre to try to use its power for ourselves... You know?
Bwahahaha! It's nonsense, of course! It's not like there could be another world out there just like ours, eh? That's why we dream, right? Wahaha! 'Cause we know our dreams can't be real!
Ah... But since we did get to run into each other like this... I think I'll give this to you!
Matt!
Yeah, bro!
This is a gift from my bro! Take good care of it.
I look forward to pitting my team against yours someday! See you then!
Wouldn't you know it... He can really make a girl's eyes sparkle. He's always like that when he meets strong Trainers. That's what I like about him, though...
Muwahahahaha! That's fun! You're crazy fun! I can tell how strong you are even though we're not battling!
I'll be looking forward to when me and my bro squash you!
Hmmph...I'd like to go there. If there is a world like that...
Oh-hoh! Sounds fun!
Ahyahya! So very intriguing!
Might be...nice...
I'm getting pumped just standing here! Let's check it out!

The Battle Frontier Project Has Started! The First Battle Frontier Facility The Battle Tower Building Model
Yo, wassup? Start a battle already!
Huh! Ground types? See if I care. If y'all are too scared of my Bug-type Pokémon, I'll battle with another Trainer instead!
Hey, you and your Pokémon look cool. Now be my Bug-type Pokémon's warm-up, will ya?
Y'all are so lame.
Ugh. Y'all are strong... I should've battled that Ground-type Trainer. But I won't lose tomorrow! I'll get ya for this!
Uh, uh, are you challenging me to battle, knowing I'm a Ground-type-Pokémon user?
(Yikes. This Bug-type-Pokémon user... He's rude and kinda scary...) Uh, uh, uh, unfortunately, I've already promised to battle with h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer. Right?
Th-th-that's right! Let's start a battle!
Hey...hey! Please read the situation, please!
Thank you! You saved me! If something happens again, help me again.
Have you seen the sign? The Battle Resort is still popular, but there is a plan to make it a more special and robust battle facility called the Battle Frontier!
This area is always hot, so you can have hot battles anytime you want! The person who created this Battle Resort has great taste.
I usually keep my cool, but I can feel the blood pumping through my veins here.
The shining sun? The sparkling beach? Meh. Not my thing at all. The only thing I care about is the excitement of scorching-hot battles!
This place is the best! In addition to the beach surrounding the island, there's even a Pokémon Day Care!
Will you come see the Battle Resort's famous Whismur show?
Yay! I'm going to get all fired up!
That's too bad... I guarantee it's great. Come see it next time!
OK! Whismur! Everyone, gather round!
The Whismur that you will be following today is...
Ta-da! The Whismur with the winsome eyes!
Ta-da! The Whismur with the fluffy ears!
Ta-da! The Whismur with the chubby cheeks!
Ta-da! The Whismur with the cute little hands!
It has [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)]. All right. Let's start!
Whim, whim. ♪
OK! Find the Whismur that I asked you to follow!
That Whismur is holding [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)], right?
You are...
Totally correct! Receive your prize, [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)] from the Whismur!
Incorrect! I'm sorry.
That marks the grand finale of our Whismur show! Thank you, one and all!
It looks like the Whismur are tired. There are a lot of preparations to make, so please come back tomorrow!
Whism, mur...
Look at how the Whismur move... Looking at them makes me feel like dancing!
Wahaha! You really like dancing, don't you?
Aim for the Pokémon World Championships! Aim for the world! I'll conquer the world with Dragon-type Pokémon!
I've collected 197 BP. Just 3 more, and I can change my Druddigon's Ability!

I'm the custodian here at the Battle Resort. All I do is take the trash out in the morning. I don't have much to do. That stuff over there is just some junk that I picked up while I was cleaning. Go on and take anything you think you could use.

Hnh. You again.
I apologize for my actions earlier. The truth of the matter is... I have no idea in the world what I am doing here... Or even who I am.
The first thing of which I can remember is awakening here upon this beach. Baffled, lacking awareness of the circumstances that brought me here... And at that moment, you appeared!
I feel...as though I have some duty that I should be accomplishing... But of it, I can remember nothing.
Please, pardon me for going on about myself. In fact... I feel quite uneasy.
Of course, I must thank you for finding me.
That, I found in the pocket of my overcoat. It was the only thing I had on me. I do not know if it will prove worth anything, but I'm glad to give it to you.
Wh-who am I? Who in the world am I?
Poor man. It seems he has amnesia.

If you are a Trainer, will you show me how you're raising your Pokémon with loving care?
Oh! You're a shy Trainer.
Which Pokémon will you show me?
[~ 3]
Well...it's a bit hard to tell how much that Egg has grown.
Oh! This [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was level [VAR NUM3(0002)] when you met. Right now it's level [VAR NUM3(0003)]!
Wow! This is surprising! You trained the Pokémon this much. You've raised it very well. It's received a lot of love from you.
You've raised it quite well. I feel your love for this Pokémon.
You've raised it well. I can feel a bit of love from you.
What? It has not grown at all. Still, if you travel with your Pokémon from now on, I'm sure it will grow!
You clearly make an effort to travel with your Pokémon and raise them! This is a token of gratitude for showing me your great love for your Pokémon!
@s received a [VAR BD00(0007,0000,0000)]Footprint Ribbon[VAR BD01]!
@s put the Footprint Ribbon on [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
This fantastic Footprint Ribbon shows the love you've given to [VAR PKNAME(0001)].
The number of footprints shows the amount of your love... Thank you for showing me the wonderful bond between you and your Pokémon.
Guwarrr!
Have you heard about the green-haired Gallade user everyone is talking about? They say that he's been a real hit at the Battle Maison—an absolute star! And he's racking up record after record with his carefully chosen Pokémon... My heart starts to race when I think that there might finally be a Trainer worthy of calling my rival!
You look like you'd be good at Pokémon battles. This belongs to someone like you!
The Level Release is a Decoration you can use in your Secret Base! If you set it up and activate it in your base, you'll be able to negate any level limitations in battle!
A serious battle in a Secret Base, with no limits... Don't you get excited just imagining it?

Eek! You...!
So you really came... Blast it...
Hrmph! Then I guess I've just got to do it...
No! It's too dangerous, baby!
It's fine, darling! I'll take care of this! You just take this chance to get away!
What are you talking about, baby? I couldn't possibly leave you here! Didn't we make a promise to each other?! We're supposed to survive together!
D-darling...
If we're going to get caught anyway, then let's get caught together! I won't leave you here alone! Whatever punishment awaits us for betraying our teams... We'll face it together!
No need to worry about that.
Y-you!!! But why?!
Team Magma...and Team Aqua both... We've all changed. And all because of this Champion next to me.
Yeah. That's how it is.
You...
No one's going to come chasing after a couple of runaways like you anymore.
Then why... How did you even find us?
I know how you think. And besides... Our leader Maxie came here, too. I could guess he had some reason for that. He never misses a detail, after all. I'm sure he knew the two of you were here.
And our Archie is just the same. He's testing himself against the fine Trainers at the Battle Maison, taking a good hard look at who he is. I don't think he's bothered at all about some runaway like you.
So that's how it is, huh?
You know. To be honest, I came here to bring you back with me, but looks like maybe I shouldn't have bothered. Just...take good care of her, you hear?
You mean...
Well, wonders never cease. To think that little Miss Magma and I would arrive at the same conclusion... But that's how it is, so... Yeah. You're free. Be as happy as you can be with that fellow of yours.
Y-you busybody... You bet I will...
I'm sorry. I'm a bit overwhelmed by all this. Could you come back a little later?
Look, sorry, but... My mind's still whirling. Can we do this later?
We've been awaiting you, Champion!
You sure kept us waiting, Champ.
We spent a long time thinking things through after what happened last time. And in the end...we both decided that we should go back to our own teams.
Team Aqua and Team Magma... We've decided to each go back to our own teams... And we were thinking maybe we could help mediate things between them.
Even a couple of Grunts like us have managed to find a way to understand one another. It seems like there has to be a way for everyone to recognize one another and move forward.
But we were only able to dream of something like that because both teams have changed already... And I think that's all thanks to what you've done.
And so that is why we hoped to ask you for a favor, Champion.
That's right. It's something we could only ask you to do.
I want you to take my Camerupt. Will you accept it from a Team Magma Grunt like me?
I raised this Camerupt because I looked up to Maxie so much. But now I want to leave its future in your hands instead.
You don't have any room in your party now. Please come back when you do...
Thank you very much. Please take good care of Camerupt. It loves to run more than anything, so I hope you'll play with it a whole lot...
Please. I beg you to reconsider. I won't leave this place until you change your mind and accept it.
I want you to take my Sharpedo. Will you take a Pokémon from a Team Aqua Grunt like me?
I chose to raise this Sharpedo because Archie was my idol. But now I think I'd rather leave its future in your hands instead.
Your party's full right now. Come back when you've got space.
Thanks for this. I'll leave Sharpedo in your care. Riding around on this fella's back while surfing... It's the best.
Please! I'm begging here! And I'm not going to move from this spot till you change your mind!
Leaving Camerupt with you was my way of cutting ties with the past. From now on, I'm going to do my best for a new Team Magma—with my baby!
I'm leaving Sharpedo with you so I can close the book on that part of my past. From now on, I'm going to do my best to make a new Team Aqua—with my darling.
You received Camerupt!
You received Sharpedo!
Would you like to give a nickname to Camerupt?
Would you like to give a nickname to Sharpedo?

Oh my, you're a Trainer, aren't you? And you came all the way out here? I live a life free from worldly cares here, just raising Berries as a diversion.
Here, I think I'll give you one of these Berries. I hear that strong Trainers sometimes use them.
If you come again tomorrow, I'll give you whatever is ripe.
Oh my, I am sorry. But I can only harvest so many a day. Come tomorrow if you want more.
I'm gonna win 100 times in a row in the Battle Maison. But I'm not very good yet... So win 100 times in a row in my place, OK?
What? You won 100 times in a row?! That's so cool! OK, I'll give you this as a reward!
Maybe you'll win 200 in a row next... Yeah, right! Like that could happen!
Y-you won 200 times in a row! That's really, really amazing! Here, take this reward!
I'll work hard and become a strong Trainer like you!
フム……　みただけで　わかるよ キミは　ただもの　ではない　トレーナーだ そのうでを　さらに　みがいて　せかい…… ポケモンワールドチャンピオンシップスに チャレンジすることを　おススメするよ
That Gentleman is a famous Trainer in the country that he hails from. It seems like he is quite taken with you, kid!

This island even has a Pokémon Day Care. What a convenient place!
How could I be so careless? I lost my purse, and I'm in a somewhat compromised situation. Well, shall I allow you to give me some money? Yes, $100 would be fine.
You're unbelievable. You're missing the opportunity to help me out.
You don't have enough money. You're missing the opportunity to help me out.
Fine. You may help me. However, my pride won't let me accept your charity. Therefore, I will show my generosity by giving you this in return.
You may embrace the happiness and express your gratitude for having been able to help me every time you use the move.
I'm a two-time champ in the Oldale Junior League! I was invited here 'cause I won the championship twice in a row!

Aha! Pokémon Journal If Pokémon with the same Speed move at the same time, nobody can tell which Pokémon will move first.
The difference between professionals and amateurs is whether or not they consider this place a resort!
Every Trainer here is a very skilled Trainer. Frolicsome Trainers have no chance!
Recently, a new member joined us. He has perfect command of a Gallade that Mega Evolves, and he studies various move combinations and the allocation of base stats. He's a very enthusiastic young man! He has a somewhat delicate frame, but I can't wait to see how he fares!

Hello! I'm traveling around the Hoenn region by Bike.
Hello! I'm traveling around the Hoenn region by Bike. Do you have a Bike, too? ... Wow! That's a Rydel Bike! It looks very cool. Maybe I should buy one, too.
I was thinking about getting a new Bike.

I may not look it, but I'm very confident of my skills in Pokémon battles. My favorite type, of course, is Grass. Now, battle me!
All right! I'll go all out!
Oh, that's too bad... If you change your mind, come back, OK?
I lost, but I had a blast! Let's battle again sometime.
The blue sea and the white beach... What a lovely place! I'd love my Fairy-type Pokémon to go wild to their heart's content. Would you care to help me?
I appreciate it. Now, please brace yourself.
My Fairy-type Pokémon said they were very disappointed.
It's regrettable that we lost... But the rippling waves here will wash away such a feeling.
Hah...hah... Ugh... What a stifling place. This is just the time for a cool victory in Pokémon battle to refresh me! I'm a Poison-type expert. Why don't you have a thrilling battle with me?
Hehehe. Fall victim to my dearest Poison-type Pokémon!
Humph! I'm ready anytime. I'll be waiting.
I can't believe... My Poison-type Pokémon lost... We...we won't lose next time!
Hello! Would you like to change the music and enjoy a different atmosphere?
Did you like it? If you want to change the music again, let me know!
Acknowledged. I can change the music anytime, so whenever you feel like it, let me know.
This is the Battle Resort. It's a paradise of Trainers: by Trainers and for Trainers.
[~ 38]

[~ 40]
Ugh...
...You. I want to ask you something. Where...where am I?
Battle...Resort? It's a battle place, yet also a...resort? I...don't...get it.
Hoenn...?
Hey! What happened to you? You're absolutely soaked to the skin! Even in a tropical place like Hoenn, if you are soaked like that, you'll catch cold!
Ah...yeah...
Oh, boy. I guess I have no other choice... Come to my cottage.
Hoenn region
Battle Resort
Only strong Trainers or wealthy people can come to this place. Either way, this is the place for a selected few.
Have you heard a rumor about the running prince with green hair? They say he appears on the beach around here early in the morning or late at night and runs around the beach many times holding a lot of Pokémon Eggs. According to the rumor, he's a thin, cute, and good-looking young man!
I reeeeally wanted to see the battles in the Battle Maison live. So, I begged and begged my daddy to take me here.
Have you heard a rumor about the battle-maniac prince with green hair? I heard he's very good looking, and my friend tried to get his attention. But he's very into battles, and all he talked about was something like base stats, type matchups, and so on.
Battle Chatelaines are here visiting from the Kalos region now. They used to live in Hoenn, so it's like visiting home for them. I hear the Battle Maison started in a shack that was around here.
I'm old and have been retired from training for quite some time now, but watching battles in the Battle Maison still makes my heart pound.
[~ 56]
[~ 57]
There are people who are itching to battle on this beach, too.
The other day, when I was swimming, I suddenly heard a splash. Something fell into the water. But there was nothing around me, no ship, no flying Pokémon, nothing. Just the vast spread of the sea... I wonder what it was...
Wow... Incredible...
Hmmm?
You two... You don't look like spectators. You must be Trainers who came here for a challenge, correct?
Challenge?
You see, people who come to the Battle Resort are divided into two types! Those who come to see battles, and those who come to battle!
Oh, is that right? But where can we battle?
What? You don't know the Battle Maison?!
No, I don't...
Oh my... All right. It's better to have you experience it rather than me explaining it in words! Make sure you visit the Battle Maison that's up on top of this island's main hill!
Thank you very much. We will be sure to do that!
All right, then. I'm leaving now. Good luck, you two!
The Battle Maison...
I'm curious about what kind of place it is, but I think I'll take a look around the island first. I've never been so far from home before, and I've never visited anything like a resort!
So I'll be off exploring, @s. But I'll see you later!
I hope we can battle again, here in this resort!
Pokémon Day Care Annex We can also raise your Pokémon here.
This place is full of strong Trainers— perfect for training! I'll gain a lot of experience here and enter the Pokémon World Championships. That's my dream!
To survive in battles here, it's not enough to gain strength in the ordinary ways. But there's Super Training! It's an effective method of making your Pokémon stronger.
I'm very careful about selecting the moves to teach my Pokémon. Of course, my favorite move is Hidden Power. It's an obvious choice for experts like me.
Thanks to my dad's Garchomp, I was able to achieve 20 consecutive wins. ♪
It's one thing to enjoy leisurely battles, but real battles can be a severe trial. Truly strong Trainers sometimes must be prepared to choose Pokémon that can win rather than their favorite Pokémon.
Society tends to expect that a man's value is determined by his looks or income, right? My take is that a man's value is determined by how strong he is in Pokémon battles! This place is filled with Trainers who are good looking AND strong. Perfect! ♪
Good reply! Nice attitude! All right. I'll give this to each of you!
It's a Vs. Recorder! You can record battles with friends and battles at the Battle Maison. It's a must-have item for a Trainer!
That sounds amazing... Are you sure I can have one?
No need to hesitate. Once you reach this place, you are our enemies and rivals! Showing generosity to one's enemies is the obligation of the strong.
Thank you very much!
