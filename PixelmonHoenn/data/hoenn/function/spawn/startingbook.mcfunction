#Welcome to the Hoenn Region!
#Embark on the Hoenn region from the 3DS games of OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire. Go solo, or bring your friends with you through a multiplayer server!
#
#In version 1 of this map, story is kept to a minimum allowing the player to explore and catch freely without road blocks. Story will come with version 2.
#
#Until then, explore the 17 cities and towns the region has to offer, and collect the eight gym badges of the region. Once all eight are collected, you can battle the Elite Four to become the new Pokemon League Champion.
#
#â€‹Battle through hundreds of trainers, and speak with hundreds more NPCs to obtain XP, Pokemon, items and badges. Locations are all based on their true-game spots, so feel free to use Serebii/Bulbapedia to find something you're looking for!
#
#Claim your own Secret Base, and decorate using ~100 unique items obtainable in shops around the region. Make your base your own, and encourage your friends to come visit!
