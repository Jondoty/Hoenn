# Hoenn
This is the datapack for the Minecraft adventure map Pixelmon Hoenn. Full project link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/pixelmon-hoenn

This repo consists of all the functions and Pixelmon settings to make the map come alive, run its story, features and environment meant to recreate the Pokemon games from Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire in Minecraft using the Pixelmon mod.

The best way to ask questions or chat about the project is through my Discord server. https://discord.gg/p5txVrp
